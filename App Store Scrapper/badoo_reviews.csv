What I’ve stated continually when being promoted for reviews is that “it’s still growing on me— if Badoo turns out NOT to cripple functionality in favor of becoming ‘pay-to-play’ then I’ll consider it ideal.” Unfortunately, I’m being met with very inconsistent in-app messaging. “Swipe 50 times for your perfect match” — then, some arbitrary number of swipes later (as little as 3 to as many as 20), I’m told “That’s all your swipes [BUY] Premium!” Um, no thanks. I consistently rated this app high because they afford communication via advertisements & viewing them. Furthermore, the purchase of credits isn’t terribly expensive. I will not, however, commit to a monthly statement over a sub-par dating app. I simply won’t. If anyone at Badoo cares to listen, here it is:
You’re making the PRECISE mistake every other app/platform makes— you’re banking on the notion that you can “hook” everyone; when you realize you cannot, you simply disable our ability to use your app. It’s unacceptable. I reside in one of the single largest metropolitan areas of the USA. There are some 9,000,000 residents. I see countless “new members” DAILY.

After submitting the above feedback I received sn email from the Badoo development team (see below).  I find their argument regarding weight to be, while noble, also to be rather selective.  The app collects and presents age, for example, as a required field.  They don’t merely confirm that each user is of legal adult age.  This is ageism; shouldn’t a 48 year old man be considered just as worthy to date a woman of any legal age as a man half his age?  I’m a 48 year old American man and I am often mistaken for 30 by females here in SE Asia where I’m living my early retirement years.  Why should I have to reveal my actual age, which might cause a young woman to filter me out of her consideration?  There seems some selective prejudice going on here.

I have been using badoo for a while now and I have enjoyed every moment of its use. They did remove live streams, but in a way I guess that was a good idea as there was a lot of rude guys that would get on my stream and say repulsive things. I highly recommend badoo. It is far better than tinder in my opinion. You can also filter out profiles that are too far away and be able to see whose close by, but, if you want to look in another city, it gives you that capability. suggestions: maybe include the extra info pieces such as single status, height , kids, etc  just right below the photo inside the card so we don’t have to scroll down to see it and we can read as we are swiping. Another idea, more filter ideas during the search such as (kids or no kids, drinking or doesn’t drink, smoking or doesn’t smoke) Thanks Badoo for the awesome experience, I will continue to use and recommend your service

Badoo is the best for me. But you also have to “play to win” meaning you have to be willing to pay for the upgrade features and use them wisely by learning to be a smooth talker. There is no fast and quick way to learn this skill. You just have to learn through trial and error or ask your buddies who are more experienced.

My only complaints are the following:

- Bots and scammer profiles sometimes are online
- Wish there was a filter for Transgender individuals. I have nothing against this community, but just like a Lesbian who only prefers women, I prefer only non-transgender women.
- Customer service can be contentious if you accidentally purchase a service when you’re drunk or tired. They don’t care. Their terms of service spells it out for you that they can do this.

2019-07-14 20:33:49,,So far I have to say this app is one of the best apps I’ve used in terms of population and features. Right off the back you have a trial of the fully unlocked version where you can see all of your likes to make matches easily. Even the free version though is pretty good. I like that even if the user doesn’t complete a written profile usually there is some good information of their living status and preferences. The only hiccup is that the responses can be overwhelming at first and a lot to digest. Good job developers.,5,False,So far one of the best,Carefreeisme2

There should be some icon for people changing their location from their actual one so it can be filtered out. There should also be a way to filter gender, because now it is only ‘boys/girl/both’ yet transgender is considered as one of those. When it should be it’s own category to filter out

This app feels more like a camshow app disguised as a dating app. The constant bombardment for premium features along with the lack of filtering shows the true intentions of the app pretty quickly . 

Yes, you can see other users and begin a chat. It's really bad when you match with someone outside of your county, and hours away. No filtering by distance ruins a lot. 

There are live shows which involve people asking for donations to 'sing' or 'cross their eyes'. Spend money to talk to someone who is premium. Spend money to be more popular.
