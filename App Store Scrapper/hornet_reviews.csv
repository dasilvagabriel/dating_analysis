Hornet‚Äôs Feed section, until recently, has been a way to get a glimpse of this especially in Asia, Russia, and South America.  That part is wonderful.   The last 3 months or so I get 3 or 4 stings a day from OBVIOUS fakes generated by Hornet.  I guess they think we are stupid. Over 3500 follows on a profile that was created today?  

Posting in my feed about this results in the post disappearing.  Replying to this profile with the question results in the message disappearing... 

Image search on google usually finds the profile pictures belong to someone on Instagram or similar.. 

Hornet has gone bad and the way they are doing it is SO OBVIOUS that I question why.  What do they stand to gain, unless the app itself is malicious?

The main problem are the fakes; at best they waste time, but at worst they‚Äôll scam you out of money and potentially your identity. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs really possible, but I‚Äôm sure lots of folks enable location tags on pics and I know one‚Äôs email is linked to many apps, including bank apps. Even if that isn‚Äôt a problem, Hornet needs to do more. If I, a user, can find where the same photo has been used in three profiles, then surely a tech company can do the same- and I‚Äôve reported quite a few profiles. I have a photo storage app that automatically identifies and collates pictures of people; why does Hornet do that? I‚Äôve been chatted up by no fewer than FIFTEEN fake scammers in one week. Hornet does offer nice advice on instant protestations of love and ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù issues, and boy do these fakes deliver there. Military, on a mission but coming home soon, maybe a dog or two... strange though, that a guy supposedly born and raised in the states can‚Äôt type in English.

It was definitely not my friend and he confirmed it. Of course the fake user was making political discourse... I really think these ‚ÄúLGBTQ+‚Äù social apps might be an attempt to make identity politics out to be more popular than it truly is. I used to be more progressive minded, as were a number of my friends, but when you see most real LGBTQ+ people in person are nothing like on these ‚ÄúLGBTQ+‚Äù social networks (whom the media doesn‚Äôt seem to publicize as much as they do the ‚Äúelites‚Äù), you realize there‚Äôs something off about the ebb and flow of these internet social networks. But then this is just for cyberloafer people without real jobs that moreso waste their time online. This is where the propaganda for identity politics flows. In my own experience, I think the discrete political movement to try to propagate our LGBTQ+ community are falling apart, which is good. Their little elite failure groups only have the Internet.

2018-11-28 06:38:05,"I came onto Hornet to search for a place where I can meet gay guys like me. I‚Äôm not one to filter, but I think it would have been nice to have a platform where gay men could just connect and converse. It might be because I didn‚Äôt stay too long but first impressions are very important.

A lot of guys that contacted me were just looking for hookups, maybe you can add a filter that differentiates people looking for pleasure and people looking for community. For first timers in a social media platform based on sexuality, I expected to get hookup requests and all of that, but I was hoping I could feel welcome.

Again I met someone, so not all was lost. He lives across the world from me but it‚Äôs cool to have a connection out of America and I don‚Äôt mind a long distance friendship. It‚Äôs a fact that there is a mix of guys who want to find friends and people to learn from and relate to and guys who just want a good night.

It‚Äôd be helpful to separate these two collective intentions to give users a better experience.

Maybe there was a filter, maybe not, it could‚Äôve came with premium even I won‚Äôt say I know for sure if you guys have a solution that some users might not acknowledge in the first place. 

Overall if you are gonna have a social platform be ready for anything, updates and feedback is important. Instead of being similar to other sites that focus on dating, try to really go for a difference and expand on quality of variety a little more than what I‚Äôve already seen.

Help users navigate directly to a community of their interests instead of having a platform where  a variety of guys can get mixed easily. 

Again you could be working on this; I love the concept and potential this app has so keep up the good work, because in the end even though I don‚Äôt use this app anymore, I found someone I genuinely connected with.

I feel good that your company feels the urge to include those of us that are unfortunate enough to have contracted but honestly no test result is truly a negative test result unless you are abstinent... Which I am pretty sure is less than 5% of the people using this app. That being said, I really find it a bit ridiculous that people put their last test date like it's supposed to bring some form of comfort instead of the 'potentially awkward' moment of the question and answer part of so many people's sex lives.

2014-11-16 17:18:12,"I thought I would update my review now that the app has been updated. Unfortunately, even on an iPhone 5, it's slow to refresh the grid or changes to a profile. This is on Wi-Fi and on LTE, so it's clearly not my phone or the network I am on.  Sometimes you still get a random error when making changes to your profile after waiting minutes for it to update.

The ""chats"" that come from Hornet are a little much. I don't care about which celebrity du jour has ""come out"", reminders to update my profile, and all the other filler. 

What I care about is an app that works near-flawlessly, has an intuitive interface, has a wide userbase, doesn't take you to the financial cleaners for basic features, or drains my battery like a vampire at a blood bank.

Hornet mostly succeeds in these areas except for the slowness and bugginess I mentioned, but also userbase which is subjective. As with any app, the people will be the same old group you see on other apps if you live outside a major metro area.

""Premium"" prices seem to be more in-line with Jack'd which is a good thing. However, none of these apps really ""have it down"" to the point it's worth a subscription.

That was my previous review, whereas after some time away, then coming back, I'd say that I feel the same.   I got a few replies, usually disappointing, and not much happening that's interesting.

Did you notice that unlike other similar apps, this one doesn't tell you when someone was last online or active??  Go figure...

2013-05-02 20:15:48,"Finally, a viable and superior alternative to Grindr, Scruff, Distinct and the others that is comprehensive, intuitive, easy to navigate, and useful. This team definitely did their homework AND development; and so far they have been very responsive to feedback.

I confess I was at first confused and troubled by the app name; I don't know anyone who ascribes positive connotations to a flying, stinging insect. But no matter. At first glance, there is an immediate sense that this is an app that can replace its predecessors on anyone's devices.

Its sleek design provides an intuitive interface that allows ready access to account features, new users, nearby contacts, a complete chat history, and even exploring other regions of a city and the world.

The profile setup is a huge improvement over Grindr's in that it allows each user to upload up to four public photos and four private ones, the latter of which may remain locked until granting permission for selected other users to see them. The same rules of no nudity apply here, ensuring that those who are looking for more than ""networking"" can search nearby contacts without having their feed cluttered with excessive and unnecessary lasciviousness. 

One of the most appealing innovations of the photo feed is that when tapping on a profile photo to declutter the screen and see it in full view, there still remains a small icon on the top left indicating which photo of the series being viewed. This is no small consideration. The icon is discreet enough to permit full viewing of a user's photos but is prominent enough to discourage would-be photo thieves from screen-capturing the pics and using them as their own.

The profile interface allows the passive-aggressive among us to send a heart to someone of interest -- similar to the ""Woof"" feature on Scruff -- but a particularly unique new feature can be found with ""notes,"" whereby a user can write and keep private up to 128 characters about the user he is viewing and/or chatting with.

There is, of course, a ""favorite"" feature here, but the Hornet team takes it to another level of social networking: users may choose to mail a specific profile to a friend, text it to a friend, and/or forward it to someone else already marked as a favorite. And this is the first app of its kind that permits users to see people who favorited their profile.

There are other features here that you'd expect from a social networking app: seeing new users and ""who checked you out,"" searching nearby, and the ability to send other pics and one's location to another user in a chat -- but this app has two very significant improvements that I think make it really stand out. 

By the tapping of a button on the home screen, a user can surf the app in ""invisible"" mode -- perfect for maintaining discretion. And the best improvement, in my view, is the ability to explore other cities, areas, regions, and even countries. Scruff had it first, but Hornet -- like so many other features -- takes it to an entirely different level with a movable map that one can adjust to explore specific areas of a town with absolute ease.

All in all, everyone who has complained for over three years about Grindr and the limitations of its successors have their Holy Grail. Provided the development team continues to be as adaptive, innovative, and responsive as they have so far shown themselves to be, this app has a long future and a good chance at domination of a lucrative market share.",5,False,Everything Grindr Wishes It Were and More,ReasonWinsOut,

2017-02-10 12:06:14,"I've been a hornet premium member for a number of years. The app used to be great and I do think they are trying.  Sadly the most recent versions are not nearly as good as former versions.  

The final deal breaker for me was that Hornet started spamming me with sales messages about wine and even worse was the political message they felt necessary to send me unsolicited.  

Business who email/message their customers with any political message are ridiculously foolish because inevitably they alienate about half their customers.  To make matters worse, when I reached out to support the gentlemen who responded told me they stand by the nonsensical statement!  While he was professional and courteous, I was even more surprised that there was no acknowledgement that mixing politics with business is a bad idea.  

Even worse, and more comical, is the Hornet staff then asked me to rate and review the app ""because they are suffering badly from a case of the ""1 Star-Trashers"" and they desperately need some 5 Star Reviews"" 

Well Hornet staff, if you'd actually take the time to look in the mirror you might not need to beg for good reviews. If you took a step outside the box and had some people with real world business and customer service experience, they would have told you in no uncertain terms that spamming your customers with political messages is a shockingly bad idea.  In the long, sad, history of bad ideas, this ranks among the worst.  

I will be sad to delete this app. It works fairly well even though not as well as it used to.  The premium version is also fairly priced although there is no way to opt out of specific messages from the Hornet team.  They provide some good info on sexual health and other topics but if you want to get that you are forced to revive political statements, sales pitches for wine, and whatever other nonsense they are going to try and shove down your throat.",2,False,Deleting,Michaeld8,
