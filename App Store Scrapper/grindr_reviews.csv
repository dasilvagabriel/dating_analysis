Providing users more filter controls to find their person of interest would be more helpful. Giving users the accessibility to find their ideal partner based on position, ethnicity, distance, height and weight helps users devote more time to interacting with their ideal person, as opposed to blocking users for being outside these margins. Also, showing users that are local as opposed to longer distance can draw more users to engage with the app and fulfill the pursuit of finding their person of interest. Alas, the filter setting should converge with other corresponding users. For instance, if a user is looking for someone within a set age range, then anyone outside of that age range should not be able to see that user from their account, unless they are within the age range. If these modifications were made on the non-premium version of Grindr, more users (especially of the younger audience) would be inclined to used Grindr.",5,False,OfficialFactsnoPrinter,Does job but here’s how it can be better

Then on the day I decide to purchase a one month membership to get the Xtra features I was banned without notice. I thought it to be a technical glitch so I reached out to the support for them and asked for reasons on the ban  and they said all I have todo is appeal the ban. I went a week without word back, and reached out again and again. Then I received a email back that only said that I now have a lifetime ban and that I’m screwed because I purchased it, but better cancel my subscription or they will keep billing me. The only thing they said why I was banned was because of community guidelines. I asked for clarification on what I violated because I had no nudity, no foul language, no in appropriate speech, and as a person I don’t talk bad about other people. 
This is a horrible app, if you are doing what you are supposed to be doing. And they are no help in trying to rectify the situation. The language that they used in there correspondence with me makes me feel like I am a bad person, and being punished for something that never happened.

I understand the need to monetize, but there are other ways - host member only community events. Prioritize member profiles in the grid. Something, anything, but safety. Why can I not delete an address I accidentally sent? What if that person actually comes to my house or stalks me? It happened. Why do men who have had accounts deleted or removed for harassment have so much access to the app, the ability to create seemingly unlimited accounts? Grindr is transparent about their non liability in safety policies but I expect more for my community. Safety cannot be guaranteed, that is a given in any space online or physical. But why is dangerous behavior permitted? Why must I, a struggling college student, pay $20/month for access to basic safety features I can find in any other social media platform? Especially in the current climate of violence towards LGBTQ people, to trans people facing disproportionate amounts of violence. I come back to the app occasionally because I like to emphasize my effort to be a part of the community, connect with people I feel seen by and safe with in a world I already see as so dangerous to people like me.

However, was told that I needed to submit an appeal to all of the accounts I had, which was one other account through my Apple ID. After submitting a second appeal for my Apple ID account I was required to know the date of creating my account, which was unknown to me since I had not used it in a long time. I was told that there was nothing they could do since I did not know when I made the account and have since not received an email back from my email sent on June 10th, 2022. It is July 4th. This all sprung from a claim that I was underage even though I had sent pictures of my drivers license to prove it, which apparently isn’t enough.

There’s apparently no other way to get your account back unless you file an appeal, so I did. The Grindr support that reviewed my case didn’t care and told me the decision was final. So I just gave up on that account and tried to create a new account but as soon as I was down creating the account, it would say the account was banned.

Cons: Unfortunately, for me, with my iPhone 12, my phone constantly freezes any time I download and use this app. Further, my phone gets extremely hot to the touch, and my battery drains so drastically that I have to charge it any time I’m using this app. These behaviors occur only when I have Grindr running. If I kill the app, my phone is fine. When I delete the app, my phone is fine. I’ve yet to do an iOS restore as a last-stitch effort, but in this nearly Web 3 era and decades of smart phones, how can this one app crash my phone so badly?

Even though I express to them that I didn’t care to know “who” reported me, I more so wanted to know the reason of my ban for example what exact term or condition did I “violate” to get banned?

If ever Grindr makes longer profile descriptions available, then I’ll give the app a well-deserved 5 stars.

Another potential improvement I’d like to suggest is making profiles clickable after running a search. Currently, a long-press only opens a small menu with 3 options (chat, tap, and favorite), but this is an altogether different user experience than elsewhere in the app. I often find myself favoriting profiles just so I can find them in a view that allows me to see the whole profile. That really needs fixing.

sending pics and videos (Jack’d: yes/ Grindr: only pics but videos gotta be sent live)

I’ve sent three emails which they’ve ignored and filled out the form in support to have ban lifted but all they did was resend a link for me to fill out the same form.

2022-08-11 09:45:18,,"Some feedback for the design and product teams: 

There are some back to basics improvements to the app UX which would make a big difference to how easy it is to use Grindr. Especially around navigation actions that people do constantly.

Can you please (re) introduce edge swipe to exit-back-to-grid from the profile page? It’s such an important navigation gesture, and having to always tap the “<“ icon in the top left is super cumbersome.

Also… it would be great if you could have swipe left and right to navigate through photos in an album. Trying to force the Instagram stories tap-to-next image affordance just doesn’t really work in this context. Even better would be to allow zooming in and out of photos without having to tap and wait (that’s something you can do from anywhere in IG which is an excellent capability).

Lastly, performance: the whole app is going slowly, but there are 2 key areas that drive me crazy: tapping into a profile, tapping to exit a profile, and tapping the little flame “tap” feature. Everything has slowed to a crawl. Pause work on new features, and devote a sprint or two to improving app performance.

As the saying goes: performance is a feature.

Unfortunately a company and people that work for this company with their own rules are suppose to represent LGBTQA+ community, but that’s not what it happens. There are so many people who are harmed by Grindr and as a proof of it, just look at their own experiences on their reviews here. 

As for example:
Grindr “Bans” users and only admits that they violated the “Policies” of the company, but doesn’t explain which of what violation occurred - by the way they change their policies all the time;

Also, Grindr removes certain people’s photos from their profiles after it has been approved and posted for a long time and explains as inappropriate but there are many other profiles with “Nasty Nudes” even though they have been reported multiple times and for a long time but nothing happens. 

These are just a few of the many injustice how the company treats users, we definitely can’t find equality here. The support is awful and irresponsible, the support is incomplete and we all know, even for those who pay for the services.

Some people are banned because other users can’t handle rejection and report them for whatever reason. Grindr should have an automated verification process. Also, if you bought a year subscription and they ban you in the first month, you won’t get your money back, you will just be prompted to cancel your renewal, which seems like a cash grab.
