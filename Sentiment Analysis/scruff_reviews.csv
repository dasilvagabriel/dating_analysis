WIth HIV and the AIDS epidemic, a generation of us was literally taken from the world, the generation that was the whole reason we can be who we are today in fact, and with them the art of cruising, bathhouses and all the kinky mysterious outlets dwindled into almost nothing. This is not from lack of necessity, mind you, so fast forward to THe social dating application age.  I definitely am one that has no issue with them, and I see them for what they are‚Ä¶ social  apps. This may generalize them for some, but yo make of them what you want, and SCRUFF is definitely my favorite. In all the time I have had SCRUFF, I can say that it has rarely been something for me to hook up as much as the rest, but that is not a dig at all. I have made and still have several good friends that I met on SCRUFF, and that meansmore to me than anything else. It‚Äôs user friendly, not too set in its namesake niche, and always keeps it interesting consistently. with out being bigger than its competitors like to fancy themselves to be.

I don‚Äôt view it as a ‚Äúhook up‚Äù site, and believe although the option is there, it‚Äôs also a great place to make new friends. The ‚Äúventure‚Äù feature is amazing and unique for these types of apps. It allows you to search guys in any area around the entire world. If you plan on traveling, I definitely suggest utilizing this feature to meet guys online before you arrive. This enables you to meet potential date, no matter what intent, and allows you to learn about the good spots friendly to our sexuality!  I did this when traveling several times, and all I can say is I was very happy and fortunate to have this app. I believe you can get a free trial before upgrading to ‚ÄúPro‚Äù, which will allow you to familiarize yourself with Scruff, and realize why upgrading is not only the best route, but is fair in features and price. Try it out! It‚Äôs undoubtedly the best tool out there for meeting new guys. I‚Äôd just like to add (because it‚Äôs happened to all of us), men on here are way more friendly and courteous. They try to constantly out-do themselves, and will even ask for your opinion or suggestions on any potential changes, but it‚Äôs unlikely as this app provides just about everything!  Xoxo",Great App!
2,,2020-12-08 01:09:40,1,False,ih02912,"Scruff is just Grindr on steroids for some reason. People talk about Grindr guys being creepy and awful, but at least you deal with a wide variety of men. This app just has the worst of the awful guys, the lowest of the low in our community; it‚Äôs disgusting. This app is geared towards ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô men, although it claims to be inclusive (more on that below), so you get all the toxic masculinity that comes along with it. I have been using this app for about 5 years and I‚Äôve only hooked up twice from it for the first time this year. I‚Äôm not going to pretend to be a stud, but I‚Äôve always had much better luck on Grindr. It‚Äôs only because the personalities of the guys on Scruff make me want to vomit so I lose interest quickly. Even if just for a quick hook up, it‚Äôs still not worth it. The app allows you to write more stuff on your profile than Grindr does, which makes some guys write entire essays about their likes and dislikes and that‚Äôs where you start seeing all the racism, and internalized homophobia even more. I could go on for hours writing about the kind of guys that get on the app, but it‚Äôs clear they only cater to a very particular audience. The app claims to be inclusive and what not, but even the staff is prejudiced. It‚Äôs clear that the good reviews mostly come from the same people who contribute the worst our community has to offer. To top it all off, the same guys will message you on Grindr, but not on Scruff. It makes no sense.",Grindr on steroids

You can spend hours reading the profiles and viewing face photos of aspiring young gay men on your Smartphone in the privacy of your home or office. You are allowed to ‚Äúwoof‚Äù any man that you might fancy. This is purely your individual choice. You can even contact any of these individuals if their profile offers any interest to you. It is up to the individual you try to contact to message you back. It may be problematic as to whether you receive a message back because that is based on mutual interest of looks, hobbies, business interests and numerous other factors. These factors can be included under the very general term of ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù. The basic plan is free. You are limited on the number of guys you can view. It is still very generous on the number of men you can view. For a nominal monthly fee you can upgrade to the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù plan. With this plan you can view many more gay men along with their profiles as well as message any guy you might want. It is very addictive to browse the guys. It is very entertaining as well.

Instead, they directed me to use their search feature, which also isn‚Äôt as robust as it could be, and doesn‚Äôt solve the problem I have, which is that the only way to get different guys to show up in my feed is to block or hide the ones who are already shown (so that there is room for other profiles to be displayed).

We have had a lot of people from the West Coast moving in who are used to a different style and pace of life and although we welcome them it‚Äôs sad to see the friendliness we‚Äôve been used to and becoming more impatient as well that is way way too specific in the types of guys they are looking for.

I deleted my Grindr soon after joining as a premium Scruff member because I felt I only ever easily found what I was searching for (with actual follow through) on this app.   But all withstanding, this recent update has been abysmal from a technical perspective.  Woofs and photo unlocks only seem to work half the time, often you have to fully back out of a chat & profile to see a new incoming message, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the photo viewing experience.   The best part of premium IMO was the ability to quickly, easily, and fully see a members photo album; to get a better sense of if someone is your type.  But now it is almost a pain to view a members full album.  If you zoom too much or in a slightly careless way, it completely bumps you out of a user‚Äôs photo album back to their main profile, sometimes happening over and over.  When you aren‚Äôt completely forced out of an album, half the time the zoom feature stops working all together.

Seeing how close some guys are is nice because you can both choose whether or not you want to develop a relationship with someone before you get to know them. 

Something that takes a bit of getting used to though is that the distance that this app shows you is as-the-crow-flys distance. In other words, my boyfriend lives 37 miles away according to the app, but in actuality he‚Äôs about an hour‚Äôs drive away from me. It might be nice if Scruff utilized Google maps to give you the driving distance instead of what it gives you because it can be misleading. 

I ultimately found the man of my dreams on Scruff and me and my boyfriend now use Scruff to communicate with each other.

At first glance the interface is wonky (Being that all gay boys start on Grindr). 
However, Scruff has amazing capabilities! Everything I could ever ask for in an app of this sort is there, it‚Äôs very well thought out. 
Some of my favorite things are the private photo albums ‚Ä¢You can quickly catch a guys attention by unlocking, rather than a nearly invisible ‚Äòhey‚Äô‚Ä¢The human body is art, one should capture it is ways that communicate that and share often‚Ä¢
I also love the fact that you can jot quick notes about someone for yourself ‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt have PRO at the moment but this would be something I‚Äôd us after every conversation‚Ä¢He likes/dislikes... Don‚Äôt talk to him he... *giggles*‚Ä¢
Lastly I enjoy the match sectioning the app ‚Ä¢I think it‚Äôs super cutesy‚Ä¢It keeps me coming back just about every day, there aren‚Äôt very many profiles that catch my attention in my area [What can I say, I‚Äôm out of their leagues]‚Ä¢It‚Äôs an awesome way to see profiles that I do not come by on a day to day bases‚Ä¢

- dedicated customer support
- a response in a timely fashion 
- a follow on customer/product request
- a follow on abuser reporting 
- service dependability, as for example messages being delivered by either parties, sender(s)/receiver(s)
- a human connections when following on on issue 
- relatable advertising, no Christian mingle or similar no sense. Just product that enhances the livelihood of our community LGTBQ community! No just anyone buying/selling something. 
I don‚Äôt give this praise because I despite Grindr‚Äôs platform so much, I know quality when I see it. I can‚Äôt wait to see Scruff‚Äôs market value and presence exceeds that of overrated Grindr.

Current version works well enough. 
New feature of going straight to chat, I‚Äôm not a fan. Would really like to see who sent the message first. Then decide whether to read it. 
I feel this app is missing out on an opportunity, a BFF feature. All this time during the lockdown, people had a difficult time meeting up. It was difficult for making new friends as well. Many felt isolated. How wonderful it would have been to have a social/make new friends section similar to Bumble‚Äôs BFF.  That feature for them is all the craze right now. I know I‚Äôm enjoying it. 
Anyway my two cents worth. 
Also, how does one become an ambassador? I see this all the time. Not sure what that feature is about. 

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Even though it‚Äôs one of the better apps, it keeps trying to be grindr. Which is a horrible app. The uptake in adds is sad. I get it. You need make money, but it can be done in a less intrusive way. Lose a star The new Beta Bear mode is a why would you want to narrow down your clientele like that. It already mostly swinger bears. Will there be an otter mode, swingers mode, looking for just friends mode etc. and what steep price will you ask for it? It‚Äôs the same local people over and over. Yawn. Its also the same people in all the other categories. It‚Äôs a finite clientele. I‚Äôve been in this app since it first appeared. And it‚Äôs quite pricy. Yikes! Part of me just says ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô. People would actually pay to see the same 100, 200 guys in there feed on a daily basis. Lose a star.",It‚Äôs a finite clientele

It is nothing like it use to be and a lot of great features have been taken away. Secondly, if you aren‚Äôt in your 20s or have an Adonis body be ready to have your pics scrutinized by their moderators! I submitted a picture that shows barely 2‚Äù of underwear fabric just above a mirror frame and it was rejected. When I contested it through there customer support, which is what you‚Äôre directed to do if you feel it‚Äôs rejected in error, I was dismissed and told never to use support again unless it‚Äôs serious. I sent pictures along with my complaint of other approved profiles with guys full body underwear pictures, semi-hard, full outlines and pubic hair showing but of cours about 10 years younger and off the cover of a magazine or clearly packing a monster. I was told to go report them, not the point! I even went as far to reach out to both Eric Silverburg and Johnny Skandros themselves about their customer support and bias handling with their policies, nothing. I‚Äôve never reached out to the CEO and founders of a business and had them act as if they could care less about their paying customers. I‚Äôve been a member since Scruffs infancy and a paying member for most of it. About to lose one more for poor customer service, all for absolutely ridiculous reasons!

***UPDATE***The response to the issue of poor customer support is to contact customer support about customer support. I some how don‚Äôt thank Daniel O is going to do anything about his own customer service skills or correct the issue I‚Äôve already contacted him multiple times about. Why should he care to act any different when the CEO and founder seem to not care and this is the kind of response that a bad review gets on the App Store?

***UPDATE 2.0*** Contacted Scruff Support AGAIN because that‚Äôs what the Developer said to do, though I‚Äôm sure I was probably complaining to Daniel O about Daniel O. My ticket went days being ignored and then was just closed with no response. Can I give negative stars?",Poor Customer Support!

The problem, however, is that Scruff version 6.0 requires you have iOS 11.0 on your phone and that iOS is not available on the iPhone 5 (which I have) or older versions of the iPhone. Therefore, I have to choose between  buying a new phone so I can use all of the premium benefits on Scruff or terminating my premium membership. I'm going to terminate my premium membership. I like Scruff but it's not worth throwing down $600-$900 on a new phone just to keep using it, and if I can't use all of the premium benefits then there is no point in paying for a premium membership.

 I have already contacted support, explained that I kept getting pop up messages demanding I upgrade to Scruff 6.0 and that I couldn't do that because the required iOS is not available for my iPhone. I also mentioned that I could not see any photo galleries. Their only response was ""Well you need to update to Scruff 6.0."" 

What?!? I just told you I can't update to Scruff 6.0 and your response is to tell me I should update to Scruff 6.0?

This used to be a great app, but this is just messed up. I guess I will terminate my Pro membership and stop using Scruff if this is how it's going to be. I can't afford a new phone right now and I certainly couldn't justify the expense solely to keep using Scruff",Latest update is unavailable for older iPhones

As for the interface, I think it's fine. It's familiar. The only feature I still think needs to be added is an indicator on a member's profile (like coloring the button orange like the unlock icon) showing that you have woofed at a person before. If you decide to woof at then again, it would also be nice if the confirmation dialog could tell you when you last woofed.

It's worth paying attention to these niche communities and how brands like Scruff play to essentially tribal affiliations to produce both ad-sales revenue, and evergreen membership fees, that are to a great extent inoculated against encroachment by Facebook.

But I wonder if anyone on the programming or management staff remembers that ""GRID"" was one of the names initially given to the disease that would eventually be known as AIDS.  It was called Gay Related Immune Deficiency, and that name reflected, in part, the ugly stigma that is still attached to that terrible plague: that gay people were somehow to blame or deserving of the suffering caused by AIDS/HIV. Now I'm not saying they should change the app or this feature, but in future upgrades and features the staff may want to consider their audience. There are, no doubt, some of our more mature scruffy brothers on the sight who lost friends to AIDS.  I know our community tends to focus on fashion in the here-and-now, but I think we could afford to reflect on our history more often, lest we forget and end up back where we were when GRID was just appearing.",History Lesson

Most impressive is the ability to use the app in landscape mode. The new views (who's online, most woof'd) look great. Tap and hold to instantly start a chat, ingenious!! Let's compare:

Grindr: requires a premium subscription to get basic features such as notifications, loaded with spam users, the app crashes constantly. 

Growlr: when it first arrived it was simple and fast, and at one time I was a Pro user. Now it's plagued by obtrusive ads/videos and the developers have done little to make it better. The more you use it, the more the creators are making money off you from the ads, and it's obvious. Worse, the quality of picture uploads is poor, making your first impression lacking.

Hornet: Ad placement is poor making your experience less enjoyable. You'll receive lots of annoying messages from the 'support team'. The app itself is clunky in some areas, and photo resolution changes after viewing others in the same profile.

Jack'd: Way too many complaints from users, not worth your time.

The interface, profile options, and easy communication have always been the best of any app out there. Most recent update is ok -- the new interface is more cluttered than I would like, it's less seamless to navigate between albums and profiles, and a lot of features were changed that didn't need changing, like the use of icons instead of words for some buttons. I'm disappointed with the new censorship of profiles: my profile was flagged for inappropriate context because is said NO PNP (flagged the word ""PNP""). The censorship script should be more intelligent than that. And the profile text is scrunched too narrowly -- an otherwise short profile now requires lots of scrolling, and those with lots of descriptive text now have to severely cut down if anyone is going to read what they have to say.

This update is like a parody of what I do: rather than reading and absorbing the Human Interface Guidelines, the app authors seem to have taken the stance that an app has the look and feel of the OS simply because it uses vibrancy effects and custom view controller transitions. Most of which are poorly executed with jerky frame updates in the completion block. The navigation structure is senseless; instead of proper stacking of view controllers, there are unnecessary modals with Done buttons. These are the least of its sins: the main screens for browsing have simply gone haywire with clutter and irrelevance. Icons have replaced text for no good reason in many places. The only real improvement I see is more seamless pagination.

Sadly, I suspect the following: most likely, the owner was led to believe his app required a top-down makeover and rewrite. This exercise was likely very expensive. Most of the old UI tropes could have been elegantly updated and modernized for the new OS features without so much rework.

 Although it's aimed at a more muscle-bear/meat and potatoes kind of guy, it doesn't come across as ""exclusive"". I like the option to ""woof"" at guys; it's a nice way to compliment a guy without being pushy or having to have a conversation. Another nice feature is the ""would you meet"" button. If both of you choose ""maybe"" or ""yes"", it suggests that you both initiate a conversation. It doesn't alert them if you choose ""no"", so both parties are spared negative perceptions.

I mean, having to pay to block more than 80 profiles? Or being able to see your full message history with another user?  If you're going to charge a whopping $100+ per year for a subscription, the extras you get for it oughta be AMAZING.  Conversely, if I'm paying a monthly charge for enabling a feature set that brings Scruff up to (and perhaps even a bit above) the functionality level of its competition, then the charge ought to be on par with that of the competition.

What really sets Scruff aside from the other apps (like A4A and Grindr) is that Scruff has incorporated the 'would you be interested in meeting this person' and the extension of 'the Stack' where Scruff randomly selects profiles from the thousands around the world and you say if you would be interested or not.  If there's an indicated interest from both parties, you are alerted and it's then up to you to make contact.  

The other new features for this version of the Scruff app is the 'who's online, New Members, Who got Woofed the Most; Most Woofed New Member and Who's Online Now Globally/Locally.  Previously it was just who was online now gloves and local.  These new sections allows you to see more guys' profile than before.

The connectivity issues do seem to be a bit to constant for my taste. 

There also seems to be way to many steps to have to go through to see: images, messages, woofs, viewers....

This is a mobile app so I would think the idea of getting to what you needed would be a little more streamlined.

I haven't upgraded to any of the extra features and have been happy I haven't due to yesterday's outage and the constant connectivity issues. From the other reviews I am also getting the idea that they charge a bit more then any other gay social apps, how does that bode for competition? I don't understand why they are charging a fee to see your back log of chats, so maybe the other negative reviewers are correct in saying someone got greedy...

Increasing the difficultly for any member to interact with a non paid member is a tactic for increasing sales that alludes to a lack of new ideas on the developers end. Paying for scruff allows me to have larger private albums -- I am not interested in this feature if not everyone can view the albums I create.

Profiles have a bit more space and direction to talk about both dating/hookup interests and less sleezy stuff, and are easier to narrow down than the other gay apps.

A few things that big me though:
You can't scroll back in message histories. I get that you can pay money for that, but as someone who is young/conventionally hot enough not to need to pay for hookup apps, it puts me in situations where I forget a guy's name because I can't scroll back. I get that saving a backlog of pics maybe is too expensive, but saving the text part would be nice.

I also wish they sent push notifications for woofs, not just messages, because I often miss woofs guys send me for several days.

While the free app is decent, it doesn't provide the search filters and a few other standard tools that the pro version offers. But if you're paying $70 a year for Scruff Pro, youve gotta be a moron.

Save your money, and instead of using one very limited free app, invest in a few free apps such as this, grinder, growler, and jack'd
