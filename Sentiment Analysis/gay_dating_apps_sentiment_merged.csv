0,5,Does job but here’s how it can be better,"The app gets the job done, although there are some modifications to make it better. Providing users more filter controls to find their person of interest would be more helpful. Giving users the accessibility to find their ideal partner based on position, ethnicity, distance, height and weight helps users devote more time to interacting with their ideal person, as opposed to blocking users for being outside these margins. Also, showing users that are local as opposed to longer distance can draw more users to engage with the app and fulfill the pursuit of finding their person of interest. Alas, the filter setting should converge with other corresponding users. For instance, if a user is looking for someone within a set age range, then anyone outside of that age range should not be able to see that user from their account, unless they are within the age range. If these modifications were made on the non-premium version of Grindr, more users (especially of the younger audience) would be inclined to used Grindr.","{'id': 22640851, 'body': ""Hi there, \n\nThank you very much for the thoughtful review!

1,1,Horrible,"I have been using this app for several years for what this app is used for. Then on the day I decide to purchase a one month membership to get the Xtra features I was banned without notice. I thought it to be a technical glitch so I reached out to the support for them and asked for reasons on the ban  and they said all I have todo is appeal the ban. I went a week without word back, and reached out again and again. Then I received a email back that only said that I now have a lifetime ban and that I’m screwed because I purchased it, but better cancel my subscription or they will keep billing me. The only thing they said why I was banned was because of community guidelines. I asked for clarification on what I violated because I had no nudity, no foul language, no in appropriate speech, and as a person I don’t talk bad about other people. 
This is a horrible app, if you are doing what you are supposed to be doing. And they are no help in trying to rectify the situation. The language that they used in there correspondence with me makes me feel like I am a bad person, and being punished for something that never happened. I have been warned about random people getting banned for no reason then get excommunicated for absolutely no reason. Shame on the company Grindr, Inc. same on what you do to loyal customers and I hope this prevents you from marking any money off of your next victim.

2,1,Safety is not a commodity,"I’ve downloaded and deleted this app several times over the years, my only issue: the safety. Users must PAY for SAFETY FEATURES. I understand the need to monetize, but there are other ways - host member only community events. Prioritize member profiles in the grid. Something, anything, but safety. Why can I not delete an address I accidentally sent? What if that person actually comes to my house or stalks me? It happened. Why do men who have had accounts deleted or removed for harassment have so much access to the app, the ability to create seemingly unlimited accounts? Grindr is transparent about their non liability in safety policies but I expect more for my community. Safety cannot be guaranteed, that is a given in any space online or physical. But why is dangerous behavior permitted? Why must I, a struggling college student, pay $20/month for access to basic safety features I can find in any other social media platform? Especially in the current climate of violence towards LGBTQ people, to trans people facing disproportionate amounts of violence. I come back to the app occasionally because I like to emphasize my effort to be a part of the community, connect with people I feel seen by and safe with in a world I already see as so dangerous to people like me. I want the community. But I’m disappointed time and time again to see Grindr devalue their users, violate and capitalize our right to safety.",,disappointed community member,False,2022-10-22 17:59:21,1
3,1,Will ban your account and ability to create any other accounts,"I’ve given this my utmost effort, and really did not want to give a bad review. The Grindr support team is not very helpful, and has not responded to me in almost a month after a 4-month battle to try and get my accounts back or restore my ability to create a new account and use the app. I was banned in March of 2022 and instantly reached out to support with an appeal, with my main profile being unbanned. However, was told that I needed to submit an appeal to all of the accounts I had, which was one other account through my Apple ID. After submitting a second appeal for my Apple ID account I was required to know the date of creating my account, which was unknown to me since I had not used it in a long time. I was told that there was nothing they could do since I did not know when I made the account and have since not received an email back from my email sent on June 10th, 2022. It is July 4th. This all sprung from a claim that I was underage even though I had sent pictures of my drivers license to prove it, which apparently isn’t enough. I’m still unable to use the app whatsoever or create a new account without an instant ban. I’m not the only person with this issue, and others have had this issue even after purchasing a subscription and completely losing the money. Beware.","{'id': 30796172, 'body': ""Hi there,\n\nWe must protect our users' security even when it's inconvenient. We cannot allow access to an account someone cannot prove is theirs.

4,1,My account got banned for no reason and Grindr support is nonexistent,"I went to a guys place 15 miles away and when I got there he had told me to “kms”, then proceeded to block me. I was obviously shocked so I decided to warn other by putting his user in my about me and warning others about him. The next day I had found out I had been blocked, I was confused and looked it up. There’s apparently no other way to get your account back unless you file an appeal, so I did. The Grindr support that reviewed my case didn’t care and told me the decision was final. So I just gave up on that account and tried to create a new account but as soon as I was down creating the account, it would say the account was banned. I’ve tried deleting the app, restarting my phone, trying different ways to create a new account, you name it I’ve tried it. All to no avail. I proceeded to reach out to Grindr support team once again but they again told me they couldn’t do anything and pretty much dismissed my problem. I had been getting tired of the app for a while but that just did it for me. What got me was how unhelpful the “support” team was, and how they literally didn’t care about what I had to say or anything. This was two weeks ago and I have not found a solution to my problem and a member of the support team even told me they will not respond to any of my further emails.","{'id': 28479323, 'body': ""Hi there,\n\nI'm sorry to read about your experience.

5,1,"Please fix your quality control, Grindr devs","The following is not a helpdesk/end-user problem; it is a long-running QC issue that should not have the buck passed on to us consumers to solve. Pros: The only thing this app has going for it in terms of positive user experience is that there are so many people using it. 1 star for the ubiquity. Cons: Unfortunately, for me, with my iPhone 12, my phone constantly freezes any time I download and use this app. Further, my phone gets extremely hot to the touch, and my battery drains so drastically that I have to charge it any time I’m using this app. These behaviors occur only when I have Grindr running. If I kill the app, my phone is fine. When I delete the app, my phone is fine. I’ve yet to do an iOS restore as a last-stitch effort, but in this nearly Web 3 era and decades of smart phones, how can this one app crash my phone so badly? I’ll tell you: sometimes I can’t even kill the app for minutes; the entire phone becomes unresponsive. Have you read their version update logs? It’s a generic description each time. What are the developers actually fixing with the plethora of versions being released? How about focusing on RAM and CPU usage? Very limited recommendation and I would never pay for it at this point.

6,1,All the reviews are fake!,"Edit!!!!! I have been reporting fake accounts, I talked to one account and they seemed fake but sent a video showing they was “real”. They send their location and their address. and right when I show up I knock and it was an old couple who said no one young lived there and when I got back on the app it was a fake account asking for a steam pay account. This account stayed up for 6 days before being taken down!!! Someone needs to be taking the owners of grindr to court for this stuff!!
This app is FULL of fake accounts, when they are reported NOTHING happens to them! At all. They upload blurry photos they got off google and then they will tag a location asking for gift cards or credit card info, others will say “tired of this app go here and enjoy” and there’s about 2 of those messages a day. So aside from the HORRIBLE amount of spam and scammers they OVERRRRR charge for a monthly membership..I’m sorry...$20 a month to see who’s 10+ miles away...? Or $20 a month to see who is a top or bottom..like really...? You can buy a Netflix membership for cheaper then they charge just for a few things. (100% not worth that price.)

7,1,Not inclusive of trans women,"For a dating app that states they cater to the LGBTQ community, they don’t really care for transgender women. I used Grindr a lot prior to my transition and never had an issue. Fast forward 5 years later and now a post-op trans woman I decided to try it out again and my account was banned after a few weeks on the app. When I reached out to appeal my ban, Nathan from “Grindr Support” stated that the decision was final, there’s nothing that can be done, and that they would not be responding to any further inquiries about my account. Even though I express to them that I didn’t care to know “who” reported me, I more so wanted to know the reason of my ban for example what exact term or condition did I “violate” to get banned? Being that I didn’t lie about who I was, I never offended/disrespected anyone, nor used fake info, my profile was the cleanest profile on that app. There are some that have their bare bottoms as their profile pics, sending endless inappropriate pictures/messages, and even some literally offering money for sexual favors…..yet, I was the one that got banned. It felt like they didn’t even bother to look into it or actually try to help. At this point I’m getting BIG transphobic vibes.

Paid subscriber for years. They just have gotten too expensive. Their pic moderation seems extremely biased and is not consistent. If you aren’t a twink or muscle guy any pic seems to get moderated. I have screen shot over 280 pics where the pic wasn’t moderated and mine was. Either it’s racial or body specific. I talking to an attorney to see what type of class action lawsuit can be filed for it to either have them consistently moderate or shut the site down.

A photo that appears to be similar, but is just over the line is not. To the untrained eye, this can appear as bias, but our moderators are highly skilled and know our guidelines.

9,4,It’s really not too bad,"I don’t think Grindr deserves ALL the hate it gets. Sure, there are a ton of bots and scams, but if your IQ is higher than room temperature, they’re so easy to spot. The ads definitely get annoying so I wish they had a bottom (lol) tier price to strictly remove ads for us poverty gays. I’d pay $5 a month for that alone. Really for an app like this, you get what you put into it. If your profile is trashy, don’t complain if your DMs are full of trash. I’ve had a lot of success using the app and made some genuine connections with some awesome guys!

All that being said, guys claiming to be 18, 19, 20 scare me sometimes since there is NO age verification on the app. I have started to avoid this age group. This is dangerous for both underage young men who are no doubt using the app and for everyone else using the app. All it takes is proof of picture ID to end this phenomenon which countless other apps already implement. I’m certain that if Grindr’s parent company doesn’t implement some sort of age verification, we will be seeing a huge lawsuit come from either a government or as a class action.",,Nobamallama,False,2022-10-22 01:27:08,2

11,4,Warning about Grindr,"What I want to say about this app that I really love Al lathe great people love have met and spoken to in it, the problem is that way too many people flake on the app or do not respond to you quickly so there’s a tendency to be somewhat upset and stressed out when you are on the app due to people playing games and making what you want to happen whether it’s a date, an interesting chat talk, hookup, and so on not happen and it leads to unhappiness and just stress. So if you download Grindr, know that you will have to have tough skin dealing with people like that cause it will have an effect on you 9 times out of 10. The stress and anxiety might come indirectly, but somehow, flakers have a way of affecting people by not meeting the need you are looking for on the app. Some people want to be in a relationship, want to hookup, go on a date.

(Yes developers, I’ve seen your responses to other reviews on this matter, but I know too many men in my own circles that are evidence to the contrary. Bottom line is your moderation system is terrible.) Speaking of my own circles, no one ever has anything good to say about this app. They just treat it like a necessary evil they have to put up with. I’m beginning to seek alternatives, and encourage others to do so as well. I would rather pay for a platform that provides me with some kind of benefit to do so, not because I feel like I’m being squeezed in a vice and have no other choice.

13,1,To be honest,App works well to network. Except glitches can really kill an opportunity. Lost messages sometimes make the other person believe you are not interested- and vice versa. When a regular text comes in on iPhone- the app gets weird. I decline the text- but the app goes offline- and photos and msgs I have sent prior to message notification are lost. Sometimes when I block soneone/ the app gets frozen- I have to turn iPhone off to restart after a long wait- usually 5 minutes. If guys are going to rely on this app- it needs to work correctly. Pics and messages need to be sent and received. Otherwise- someone may become offended that you have not responded to their message- and block you. When I send error reports- when I get a notification- what happens? Do you use this ? Or is it a waste of my time.? Until grinder gets kinks worked out- guys will use several apps at once- and not trust this app. Also- location goes haywire on occasion.

How many times do you see a white male in his underwear with the lining of his penis? (All the time) or any other “attractive” male. If any other race or person does that their picture is immediately removed. The culture that Grindr calls “inclusive” is the exact opposite. Grindr has been the worst experience when it comes to advertising of sexiness in races and culture. The LGBT community and the rest of the world as a whole is also to blame for this lack of consideration. Downloading this app was one of the worst decisions I have ever made in my life. Grindr and its developers are out to take our money and that’s it. The subscription prices are out of hand, and the amount of ads you see are insane. Scruff doesn’t force you to watch an ad to satisfy their ad experience. There are also more features and more people to see on Scruff.

Every time a Grindr server goes down, my app shows a “Cannot Refresh Page” error. Then, when the server is finally back up, my app becomes broken and crashes each time I attempt to open it. The only solution is to delete & redownload the app, which deletes all of my settings, blocked accounts, messages, and photos. This is an app I pay for — a pretty large sum of money too. Yet, I have had to delete all of my data three times these past several weeks. Backing up chats is cumbersome, as you’re rarely asked to back them up and it’s just weird to make users manually do it when it’s a task that should’ve been automated.

Additionally, they actually offer zero support in terms of preventing this type of behavior. I ended up hopping off the app hoping they’d get bored but they persisted. 

There is no verified status (tinder has), and no internal system that tracks similar photos being uploaded by other users. It’s actually quite funny that when you post a photo you have a period of waiting where it needs to be approved. Why aren’t people caught at this stage for using someone else’s photos? At a bare minimum if you’re charging that much for ultimate - you need to include some safety features. Ideally, incorporate safety for all users.

When I check my app history it does indeed show I have downloaded 2 different apps from the app store.

But then Apple issued it a different ID that doesn’t match the previous one. Fix it!! I got hundreds of chats and photos in that backup that I want back!

While most of them have been great, paid grindr is actually worse than the free version. You consistently have to force close the app for some of the extra features to work (the recently viewed tab for instance). The paid version has a message search feature. This has never, ever worked. In fact, it's crashed the app every time I've ever tried to use it. I don't bother anymore. I recently opened the app and found that the interface had reverted to the free version, as if I had cancelled my subscription (I hadn't). This is the second time this has happened. 

The worst part? I've opened tickets about most of these issues. They've never fixed any of them after multiple app updates. They just tell you to force close the app, or delete and re-download it. Anyway, I'll be cancelling my subscription soon, and I wouldn't recommend the paid version to others. You're just paying for a buggy app where the free version is much more stable.",,Lazarus Riley,False,2021-02-10 01:11:08,1
20,5,GOOD JOB FOR WHAT?!,"Grindr and Jack’d are ANALOGOUS for what?Might as well be one app.
Only thing different is the target audience (Grindr: privilege/ Jack’d: Minority), 
allowing screenshots within chat (Grindr: Yes/ Jack’d: No) 
though in my opinion i think screenshots should be disabled within the whole app itself, but if not at least the profile search page to see who’s nearby out of respect of others’ privacy that they claim they want,
sending pics and videos (Jack’d: yes/ Grindr: only pics but videos gotta be sent live) 
and i get the live video from Grindr but wen i wanna feel lazy i just wanna send the video i already got that’s been working just fine to confirm that I’m legit because this black don’t crack,
navigational location dropping (Jack’d: yes/ Grindr: No) 
and Grindr drops the location but you would have to type it out unless you have the world map memorized,
and maybe the subscription but that’s sad in itself should jus be one price in my opinion, but we got profit feens.
Other than that everything is cool i mean there’s probably other things i haven’t covered but there are other issues not pertaining to the apps but individuals themselves that may need time to look at a reflection of themselves to reevaluate and I'm still learning this myself. Just gotta take it a day at a time and use your time wisely.",,La Flo Real,False,2021-08-22 17:23:21,3

Customer service reported and they are now not even responding. I cannot enter email address for account it’s the same window when reinstall it every time.  I don’t have another number to enter.

22,1,FORCED UPDATES,"They are FORCING you to update. With every update there are less and less guys on your feed and access to les and less features. They constantly limit your feed and create blocks with the explore feature. Its bad enough you have to watch the ADS after every message, they do everything to inconvenience you, waste your TIME, just to corral you into buying premium when you are simply trying to connect with a few people on the grid. If I cant see all the guys in my small town within a 5 mile radius, theres something WRONG with that! Its ALSO discrimination against low income individuals, people of color, and minority communities. especially when they REMOVED the feature that let me find my own people, you cant search by “race” anymore, so if you want to connect with your own people, GOOD LUCK! I shouldn't have to use the EXPLORE feature just to find my own people, and even with that they limit you to 3 “free” searches per day.

23,1,ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY,"Grindr does not protect its community. They DO NOT uphold their own community guidelines and the photo moderators are a joke. A profile has been reported over ten times for a prominently displayed unobstructed view of an erect penis as its public profile photo. It is clearly pornographic in nature and explicitly banned in the community guidelines. And yet the photo moderators keep letting the user post it. In app reports result in zero action. Emails to the grindr help desk get stock responses claiming the issue has been rectified without addressing the fact they keep letting this happen. They take the photo down then let the user post it up right away. Complaints to grindr go unanswered. What is the point in allowing users to indicate they do not want to receive unsolicited nude photos while simultaneously subjecting them to the same images?!? DO YOUR JOB AND PROTECT THE COMMUNITY. Now cue a stock response from the app developers not actually addressing the complaint….

25,1,People using my photos AGAIN,"It’s happened a few time on this site to where it was brought to my attention that a user was using my photos. Im not even on this site and I haven’t been for years. They do nothing for verification and those using my photos were harassing other users. This is troubling especially in contrast to the work that I do. In the past I have come to realize that, If you use this app, expect to meet those with fake profiles and those that solicit money for sex. Next time I will have to take legal action against the app for defamation if they continue to allow the use of my copyrighted photos. Such apps should not be allowed on the App Store. On all personal sites, no one should be allowed to troll with no photo, no info, or at least with out verification. If these sites used verification, it will end fake users and identity theft. Discretion defeats the purpose on this site and catering to those of discretion causes way more problems then the disallowing of it. It’s a personals site, stop allowing those that hide and watch the app soar.","{'id': 8227213, 'body': 'Rest assured that Grindr does not condone or allow impersonation in the community, 🚫 we strive to create a safe and comfortable place for everyone in our App. Please contact us at help-ios@grindr.com so we can remove these profiles.', 'modified': '2021-11-10T19:39:34Z'}",WhoIAm2U,True,2021-11-10 19:39:34,1

27,4,Suggested app improvements,"Some feedback for the design and product teams: 

There are some back to basics improvements to the app UX which would make a big difference to how easy it is to use Grindr. Especially around navigation actions that people do constantly.

Can you please (re) introduce edge swipe to exit-back-to-grid from the profile page? It’s such an important navigation gesture, and having to always tap the “<“ icon in the top left is super cumbersome.

Also… it would be great if you could have swipe left and right to navigate through photos in an album. Trying to force the Instagram stories tap-to-next image affordance just doesn’t really work in this context. Even better would be to allow zooming in and out of photos without having to tap and wait (that’s something you can do from anywhere in IG which is an excellent capability).

Lastly, performance: the whole app is going slowly, but there are 2 key areas that drive me crazy: tapping into a profile, tapping to exit a profile, and tapping the little flame “tap” feature. Everything has slowed to a crawl. Pause work on new features, and devote a sprint or two to improving app performance.

As the saying goes: performance is a feature. 

Thanks so much!",,apple napple,False,2022-08-11 09:45:18,3
28,1,Bad verification cannot get account back,"I signed up for Grindr under the unlimited membership and mistyped my email address. Since Grindr does phone verification and also does not send a welcome email,  instead of verifying email address and then phone, I was never aware of my mistake. Now I am locked out of my account and I have sent them my photo I’d and my profile pictures and they are not able to restore my account to me after 3 support tickets. I will be talking to the attorney general. I sent in my pictures and my drivers license and they say I can’t have my account unless I know the email address. Why can’t you use the phone that I verified it with. If you can’t give me my account with my own pictures then what hope is there. I called the company and left a detailed message. The system is flawed for sure. It needs to verify your email and your phone instead of just phone. If you sign up make sure you type in and screenshot it what email address you used otherwise if you lose it you are likely screwed.",,MattyHart,False,2021-01-16 15:25:34,1
29,2,Really going downhill since I was last using it.,"Honestly this app used to be really good at one time. But honestly it’s on a decline for me. Between the spam accounts, nothing being done about reporting abusive accounts, and the biggest is everything is becoming xtra on the app. 

I can understand needing to make money from an app and rightfully so but honestly with the newest update and now the fresh section only lets you view 6 people and anymore is now xtra when before you could view 20 people. And before that it was 5$ to use xtra for 24 hrs now it’s 10$. Everything in the app is pretty much going xtra now. 

I laugh thinking one day I’m going to open the app and it’s gonna say “xtra to open the app”. Like I said I can understand making money off the app but there’s a limit between making money and annoying consumers who use it by starting to limit it especially when there’s ads running almost every time you click on something in the app.",,Zoldmugi,False,2022-08-03 18:50:41,2
30,1,Crashing issues,"In the last week, my Grindr app has started crashing every time I’ve tried opening it, sending me right back to my home screen. I was a couple versions behind, so I thought upgrading it to the most recent version would fix it. It didn’t. I used a third party program to downgrade my app version even lower to see if maybe it was just a recent bug. Nope! Still crashing as low as 7.17.0. I believe this issue is server sided and nothing to do with the app version.

And despite having chats backed up, attempting to reinstall the app wiped my chat history AND my chat backup. I don’t really understand what the purpose is for cloud backups if reinstalling the app deletes them. Under what other circumstances would someone need chat backups other than having to reinstall the app?

I was in contact with the Grindr help email and they told me this was a bug they were aware was affecting multiple people. I hope they fix it soon, because these reviews are filled with people experiencing the same problem as I am.",,MyHatRules,False,2022-04-30 19:15:25,1
31,1,Grindr is grinding itself away,"Grindr go ahead and chew your own leg off. You are eating away at your product and customer base and goodwill. You should never have sold out, that’s when you went downhill. Foremost the price. Y’all lost your minds when you thought people would pay your original price for “unlimited”. You squandered those of us who had been paying for “Xtra” on that. I’d go with $99/year but even that is grossly pushing it and forget that $150+ mess you keep angling for.   Connection has been better lately but messages are still hit & miss coming through at times. Like how long now have we had instant messaging? Other apps seem to have conquered it a decade ago but you’re still working on it. Also the catfish and the bots on there are out of control but you won’t let people verify themselves and reflect that confirmation in their profiles. Identity and data theft is rampant.

32,1,I’ll never be back,"Not entirely by choice I’ll admit. But it’s time. I’ve hated Grindr and it’s toxic environment for long enough. After having my account banned countless times for no reason, no communication for explanation etc. I know there are others who have experience this. After just subscribing to extra 3 or 4 days ago then getting my account banned, because someone was rude to me, called me stupid in the app, and was upset when I then politely declined them. 
This sort of thing is all too common with this app. There is no other behavior or engagements I have prior to being banned each and every time this has happened. After paying money this time though for a more optimal experience, I am officially cutting my losses as I don’t expect trying for a refund is worth my time, imagining the lack of customer support.

I know the rules and I haven’t broken a single one, so I have no clue what this could possibly be about. The only thing I can think of for this random ban is that maybe a lot of people reported me because they are upset that I did not text back??? I have no clue, I did get quite a bit of messages and maybe people got mad that I wasn’t responding to most of their unsolicited d pics and “hey” messages. But, even if I did do something wrong, why would grindr not tell you? Or give you a warning?  You are only left with the knowledge that you broke their rules but they do not specify which ones. I tried to appeal but they purposefully made that process complicated and they have not yet got back to me after making that appeal.
They will ban you out of nowhere and  never tell you what you did wrong, it’s just a matter of when tbh.","{'id': 32960768, 'body': ""We at Grindr assure you that we don't ban for no reason.

34,2,A basic review.,"As an 18 year old, this app can be filtered by age, body type, and much more. Throughout my experience, this is not a dating app. I’ve had numerous accounts say they’d love to 🔩 me in my house, car, etc. I’ve had to delete my profile lots of times because of these issues. I’ve also had to move to Tinder because other guys are horny for younger guys. In extreme measures, I have had to involve the police due to a person that stalked me, threatened me and would do bodily harm towards me. I always feel like an object when I use the app. Just because of my body, face, and the clothing I wear. If the app had a verified badge by the name (like Tinder does), the app would be safer to know who you are meeting with. I also fear for my safety as the men on this app are really disgusting. As a person still trying to find my sexuality, this is not an app to download if you want to date. I’d highly recommend Tinder. Overall, not a dating app. It is unsafe.

Grindr harasses its free members to get a paid subscription by bombarding them with ads in the midst of replying or viewing a message. I’m convinced that the ads are not meant to be relevant to most end users, but rather to annoy them into a paid subscription. 

The other thing that Grindr does to its unpaid members that it does not do to its paid members, is that it purposely limits the amount of people you can view who are online and in your proximity and rather shows you people who are offline and further away. The latest app update also brought with it a glitch that shows users to be within a few thousand feet from you when in reality they are a few miles away.

36,1,Security risk caused ban,This apps support and security are abysmal. My profile was hacked by their lack of security allowing someone to reset my password. Support simply banned me after I was hacked and was no help in me recovering profile and they didn’t even believe that I was hacked until weeks of emails. They just said I know it was you. I lost that account snd had to make a new one but they did not delete the hacked profile. This app is full of scam artists snd drug dealers they do nothing about. The scams are run by the support staff themselves. That’s how they never get banned. My new account was banned for absolutely nothing. I’ve sent three emails which they’ve ignored and filled out the form in support to have ban lifted but all they did was resend a link for me to fill out the same form. So obviously support is just AI software and not a real human.

We never knew if the account got banned or terminated and I would love if they add a feature to where they update you about the situation. It would be super helpful.

It’s almost like the “X” at the top right corner or the close ad buttons are just there for show. You can’t close the ad at all most of the time. I usually have to force close the app to get the ad to go away. Just opening a message or checking who viewed me initiates this ad that literally will not go away unless I close the app! Is that good for you guys? Ads that literally force the consumer to close the app? It can’t be! A lot of times I’m so discouraged by all the ads I don’t even come back after force closing.

43,1,False ads,Grindr uses ads to keep the app free. But what nobody has brought up is that these ads make you click them and interact. With you clicking on that screen on those ads you are pressing a yes button to all sorts of other things behind the scenes. After doing so you’ll start to get texts from random numbers that are down right disgusting with links to pages that are just as bad. These ads need to be checked by Apple and I think with a full investigation. These links are to steal even more information and I know for a fact that Grindr is the ONLY way I’d be getting text and calls like these. Awful. Btw they don’t stop even if you block the numbers. Grindr is terrible at keeping up with bans and will also ban you permanently without any warnings or really looking into the problem with the users.

44,1,Poor App Function,"The one thing grindr has going for it is it’s ubiquity, it is the app with the largest user base and they know it. I can ignore the ads, overpriced subscription, and poor app management but the app has become largely unusable in the last few months. 

I have encountered a bug that crashes my phone and prevents the app from rebooting unless it is reinstalled from the App Store. This wouldn’t be a anything more than a hassle but every time it happens, I lose any chats I haven’t backed up to the iCloud. Entire conversations gone, embarrassing questions about who I’ve been chatting with, general frustration every time it happens. When I reached out to support they just said they are aware of the issue. This has been happening for several months now (at least since April for me) and there has been no attempts to remedy this bug.

45,3,Grindr is… well. Grindr.,"Grindr is a mess. Sure, it may make meeting other guys easily accessible. Although the pure fact that Grindr subliminally markets itself as way to get intimate with strangers while still claiming it’s for ‘gay dating’ is disappointing. What’s more sad is, most men let how they meet someone, and the platform they connected on, dictate that entire friendship/relationship moving forward. There’s so many double standards on the platform, which makes it harder to connect and create meaningful connections with people.

Also, it makes my iPhone 13 Pro Max feel like the surface of the sun, only with a few minutes of usage. Causes the display to Dim to a brightness I can barely even read. When you force reset your device as well, it causes the application to crash upon each attempt to launch the app. There’s still no fix for this.","{'id': 32892488, 'body': 'We’re sorry to hear you haven’t had a great experience on the app yet.

46,1,Grindr Gods continue to ruin app,"Instead of focusing on real improvements to the app like ridding spam bots once and for all, the Grindr gods continue to screw around with features like tags and age search functions. Instead of allowing their users choice in how they search for compatible matches the Grindr Gods continue to make things harder on their customers. 

Focusing solely on the issue of age searches, Grindr Gods have decided that no one will be permitted to search narrowly for users by age ranges any less than four years. The claim according to their customer service agents is that by setting it up that way it allows users to search more broadly for compatible matches. This of course is false because those who have free accounts (who are already limited to _ # of accounts that appear), are now further limited. 

If someone aged 19 wanted to find other 19 year olds in their area, they are now restricted from doing so and now can only search within a range up to 23. Likewise, a 35 year old seeking other 35 years olds must now default up to 39. Again, the Grindr Gods claim you get an expanded pool. Actually, the opposite is true because filtering by one year at a time could allow you to truly find more people, even if it at the cost of geographic proximity.  

Grindr needs to restore choice to its customers/users instead of telling us what they think is best for us.","{'id': 28525214, 'body': ""Hi there,\n\nWe really appreciate your feedback on the recent age filter changes that we've made.

Grindr will randomly cause my phone to restart, at first I thought it was related to how many preference filters I had at once, when I reduced them nothing changed. When I turned them all off nothing changed. Once my phone restarts I’ll try to open grindr and it will shut down before the app loads. I’ve tried restarting my phone rather than reinstalling, but that doesn’t work either. 

Once I reinstall I’ve lost all my messages, all my photos, everything except my profile pic and info is just gone. This can be upsetting for obvious reasons, but I think the worst is that I have previously paid for a 3 month subscription which was cancelled after 1 day because of this glitch. I have not received a refund nor have I received the service I paid for. So 3 months worth of money just down the drain? For a few hours of usage?

At this point I’ve given up. This app is useless, overall a terrible user experience, if you have the money to actually enjoy the apps features you’ll just lose it due to glitches and bugs. Highly recommend avoiding this app at all costs.","{'id': 30226701, 'body': ""Hi Noah,\n\nWe're sorry that you've had such a frustrating experience on our platform.

I’ll try to swipe to my home screen or swipe to close the app and even that gets very slow to the point where my phone will lock more than 5 seconds after I press the lock button.

Now it seems that I am unable to communicate with people of interests if they exceeds the radius I am searching for (either that or the number of profiles XTRA members can view and interact with). It seems silly that this feature was removed from a mid-tier subscription and bumped to a more expensive subscription. I was perfectly content with purchasing XTRA for the price point with that feature but now it seems that we are paying the same amount while losing features.

So you lose any connections, messages, everything. Yet the notifications keep coming even though I can’t launch the app at all anymore. Many of us pay a solid amount of money to this app over the years and its consistently unusable. Should get no stars as it won’t work reliably.

52,2,Get paid version or uninstall,"It’s just as useful as Grindr has always been, but now it’s just not worth how many ads one has to deal with to use the app. 

When I log in, I can look at one thing before I get an ad... NEWS FLASH: this app is meant to be used by checking in often. If I am just opening the app to check the area around me quickly, why would I be okay with having to watch a Candy Crush ad for any amount of time? 

Banner ads and these extremely numerous pop-ups are not the end of it. The user gets notification that someone sent you a message? No— there’s an ad in your inbox. Or two. Or three sometimes. Literally sometimes I have three unread messages in my inbox, I get so excited, and then I open the app and it’s three ads. PLUS if I want to delete any of those “messages” it might trigger a pop-up ad. 

Honestly the app just pisses me off when it forces me to watch an ad in the first five seconds of opening the app. Usually it puts me off to where I won’t open the app again for a while. Sometimes I have messages built up for days because the ads only let me read one message at a time.

Your “customer service” center replied saying they can’t tell me why I was banned, and the decision is final and will not be reviewed again. I’ve since tried and have gotten ZERO response. If you are going to ban someone, at LEAST tell them what rule or guideline they’ve broken, and give them a chance to redeem.

But the free version is pretty good. The only real issue I’ve had with the app is the constant ads. It’s hard to do anything because the majority of the time your screen is covered with an unskipable ad. Sometimes you can’t ever close them, and have to restart the app, only to be immediately greeted by… another ad!

However, this new update is something else. They changed the profile hud, and now it’s almost impossible to full screen a photo. And if you tap through their photos one too many times, it now will move you to the next profile. Very frustrating. 

But the real killer is whatever bitcoin mining crap or whatever it is they did behind the scenes. The app is now almost unfunctional. It will crash two or three times every time you use it, and might take 2 or 3 minutes just to load a new chat. It got so unbearable that I couldn’t even open the app, so I had to redownload it and lost all my recent chats with 20 unopened messages.

Server-side, the distance tracking doesn’t always update after pulling to refresh. Earlier last week it wasn’t even able to load Nearby.

One major red flag to start looking for scammers is whether they have their location hidden.  Some legitimate guys block it, but it’s a good reason to be on your guard.  Again, I get nearly ZERO scammers and bots on Scruff.

Finally, the subscription cost is MUCH more than it’s worth.  I understand they need to make money and it costs to maintain, etc.  But when they are putting ZERO effort to squelch scammers and bots.  I will be canceling my subscription when it renews.

Unfortunately they do everything else wrong. There is no actual customer service. Send them and email and weeks later you will get a canned response. The app is full of ads but worse are the bots! Grindr will randomly ban your account and your device with no reason given. So I assume your iPhone can never again be used to connect to the app (by you or someone who may buy your phone from you). Honestly, save yourself the time and frustration. Guys need to start using the many other apps out there that don’t give their users so many issues.

Also, removing the ability to choose to filter out certain races was not a smart idea.

93,1,Scammers and bots,For an app with so many users I’d expect their support and maintenance of fake accounts and scam accounts to be a lot better I can’t go one day without getting 4-5 messages from a scam account asking me to go to a certain website for sex or nudes or someone trying to get my bank information and they can’t say “we have no way mpf monitoring that” because clearly other apps do seeing as this is the only app I’ve ever had this problem with and the amount of adds are ridiculous if you’re going to try to charge so much for your app’s higher memberships at least make sure we are having a good experience with the free version or is the high price to get rid of the scam accounts if so that’s great marketing... your app is literal trash along with your developers and customer service.,,cmac_56,False,2020-12-27 21:45:28,1
94,1,Poor quality app,"Prior to today, Grindr would merely drain my phone battery faster than any other app, including competing apps like Scruff. It would also heat up my phone like no other app as though it is trying to process something in the background (very sus). Today, however, it crashes immediately when opening it. Doesn’t even give me a chance to drain my battery.

This combined with the ridiculous amounts of spam and fake accounts make Grindr just crap. I get a couple spam messages a day yet Grindr seemingly does nothing to stop the fake accounts. Meanwhile, Scruff rolled out verified profiles months ago and has never had the amount of spam I experience on Grindr.

Even with a subscription it’s crippled unless you go unlimited for an extra $40 per month. It crashes like ALOT. No kidding. The sad part is that it has always been buggy. I have gigabit service and it still can’t refresh and gets stuck. Lots of foreign actors spamming me. Anyone with location services turned off is a scammer. Just block them. Also they don’t understand SAE measurements so the height and weights don’t match the photo and it’s usually just one poor resolution screen capture pic so there’s a clue. Stay safe out there.

Further your app uses a ridiculous amount of analytics to take as much user data as possible to monetize for your intrusive and likely illegal ads. 

Your mobile ads, have a strategically placed icon over the option to dismiss the ad, or to click it’s privacy policy. 

Forcing the user to stay in the add the minimum time allowed, just long enough to generate your ad revenue. 

That’s disgusting, disrespectful to your users since 2009, and an insult to those who follow your platforms rules.

Servers constantly crashing, saying unable to refresh, “connecting” that’s all technical and is related to the poor upkeep of your servers.

Apparently I was reporting too many profiles and this was distracting to the techs pulling them away from their duties.  Huh??? Each profile reported violated Grindr’s policy and each profile reported I can prove violated policy.  As a full paid client, I did not expect this poor reason.

Customer service that is corresponding via e-mail are the most unprofessional individuals. The LGBTQ Community should start developing an alternative app and people should move away from Grindr.

Update after Developer’s response:

I’d never again, even if they pay me, use Grindr application.

101,3,"Slow, sluggish and often freezes and renders the entire phone useless","Thank you for making this app, I’m sure it’s not easy to maintain. I like the app but find myself using it less and less because it seems to take over my entire system. 

It will usually work for maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute and then it immediately drags, loads so slow that I have to simply put down the phone, walk away and hope I can do something else. In an environment of communication or chat it is horrible. To type hello has taken anywhere from 15-30 seconds. 

The phone gets very hot, it impacts my ability to use the phone at all and sometimes freezes and I have to leave the phone for minutes until it comes back to use. 

The Grindr app is the only one that does this on my phone; I deleted the app for 6 months and contemplating again as I can’t afford the time kill. 

I have iPhone 12, IOS 15.3 up-to-date, I have stopped the device, restarted the phone and reinstalled several times.

102,4,After six weeks...,"...it turns out I like Grinder a lot. I like the directness of it, I like the ethnic and age diversity. and even tho I am older than the general  demographic I am delighted that I am still attractive to men!

Of course, the 'once and done' part is frustrating, but that's hook-up culture in general, not Grinder. And I've had some great conversations and met some very sweet guys.  

One grumble are some of the ads. I understand that they are necessary, but some of the ones that pop up are really obnoxious (like the PayPal/Solitaire add that will sometimes literally not go away unless I log out) or the one game ad that features someone with a sub-machine gun mowing down hundreds of people--which given our out-of-control gun culture is both distressing and tone deaf. (And I know game culture is violent, but does Grinder really have to support it?)

Also, it would be nice to be able to delete one's trace (like one can on Adam4dam) but that's a minor complaint.

People can find where one is based on other user’s locations whether they like it or not. The opt out of location sharing still does not opt a person out of the grid. So much stalking occurs due to this. On top of this the company has been selling identifiable user data to data brokers (your exact location, email address, phone number etc.. This company should not still exist for having done this. There are still data “leaks” as well. The company has no concern for user privacy and misleads its users.

These apps are a great tool in meeting for some, but it can also be a sketchy place. Catfish will use other users photos, or just take someone’s photo from Instagram or Facebook, claiming to be them.

It would be very helpful if there was an option to opt out of advertisements (for a 1 time payment). Because, if you use the free version of the app (like me), every time you message someone or block someone, an add pops up. It is very frustrating!

I personally had a horrible experience with a stalker who made multiple profiles of me on Grindr in different countries and linked my Instagram to every one. He contacted several friends and family members, saying lies to hurt my reputation. This lasted about two years and I never found out who they are. I filed multiple reports and Grindr didn’t do anything about it; I even went to the police several times and the digital crimes unit of my local police station tried contacting Grindr to no avail.

120,5,underage problem,there is a huge flaw with this app. you can be 17 and download it which is already a red flag. then they don’t have any systems of checks or balances to assure if someone is 18 or not. just per reports and speculations. an ID check would definitely help this app improve. right now there’s plenty of minors on the app if you’re a predator please do not take advantage of that situation! grindr do better and prevent kids from accessing your site. no simple ‘are you 18’ question is working you guys are ignorant if you think that works.

121,3,Spammers allowed to use Grindr’s bad algorithms to ban those who report them,"I was repeatedly targeted by mostly Ghanaian trolls claiming to be US military men looking for love so they could collect and sell my information. When they realized I wasn’t falling for it, they reported me to Grindr and Grindr banned me. Permanently. 

The reason this happened, and can easily happen to you, is that Grindr is built on a system that makes it nearly impossible to restore an account, have a fair hearing with human interaction, or even receive human email communications to dispute the company’s seemingly arbitrary decisions to disable or ban an account. 

I was told they had the right to ban an account for any - or no - reason at all. That was the most specific explanation I was given after many attempts to understand my banishment. 

This system allows the anti-LGBTQ+ trolls who target Grindr’s members nearly free reign. And Grindr allows it.

And now a computer generated Grindr response saying they take these comments seriously in............

122,1,Tragic,"Tragic is the only word to describe this app. It’s really sad how greedy the developers got before they sold out. It’s all about selling your personal data including your searches and health history. There’s not even the pretense of being interested in operating a “dating” or hookup app. You’re just another income stream and all the data on your phone is for sale.  
Every even slightly worthwhile feature is hidden behind an overpriced subscription. Seriously, read the fine print of the user agreement. It’s truly frightening. 
Most of the profiles are fakes or “anonymous” with no photos or any profile information. And the ads are not only non-stop, but they’re for kiddie games, which makes one wonder if the developers are marketing this to 8-year-olds. 
 Geolocation is a joke! 
The “acceptable” photo policy is draconian and probably censored by Chinese party officials. It’s probably why most profiles are blanks. 
There are plenty of better gay hookup apps. Pass this one by. They’ve built in plenty of fake profiles and bots to make it appear that you’re being cruised, but any idiot can tell that it’s all a fraud.

This shouldn’t happen unless you do inadequate regression testing, you don’t care about your existing customers’ experience or you care more about making money from new feature changes.

Furthermore, if the app is trying to create a better online environment, the least they could do is list the reasons why you are getting banned and educate their users so they not what not to do. Having an array of reasons why you’d get banned that don’t pertain to you seems ludacris. 

Some people are banned because other users can’t handle rejection and report them for whatever reason. Grindr should have an automated verification process. Also, if you bought a year subscription and they ban you in the first month, you won’t get your money back, you will just be prompted to cancel your renewal, which seems like a cash grab.

Now, that isn’t necessarily Grindr’s fault, but they don’t do much to curb it. For such exclusion, they are grossly overpriced Xtra features. It’s literally priced similar to a home utility service.

The tons and tons of spam and bot accounts are ridiculous. Their inability to control that issue is perplexing; considering their cost for paid services, as well as the ad revenue.

Grindr is a great place to meet guys, depending where you’re located. However, it could stand to use some useful features. The “tap” feature is not one of them.

WIth HIV and the AIDS epidemic, a generation of us was literally taken from the world, the generation that was the whole reason we can be who we are today in fact, and with them the art of cruising, bathhouses and all the kinky mysterious outlets dwindled into almost nothing. This is not from lack of necessity, mind you, so fast forward to THe social dating application age.  I definitely am one that has no issue with them, and I see them for what they are… social  apps. This may generalize them for some, but yo make of them what you want, and SCRUFF is definitely my favorite. In all the time I have had SCRUFF, I can say that it has rarely been something for me to hook up as much as the rest, but that is not a dig at all. I have made and still have several good friends that I met on SCRUFF, and that meansmore to me than anything else.

It allows you to search guys in any area around the entire world. If you plan on traveling, I definitely suggest utilizing this feature to meet guys online before you arrive. This enables you to meet potential date, no matter what intent, and allows you to learn about the good spots friendly to our sexuality!  I did this when traveling several times, and all I can say is I was very happy and fortunate to have this app. I believe you can get a free trial before upgrading to “Pro”, which will allow you to familiarize yourself with Scruff, and realize why upgrading is not only the best route, but is fair in features and price. Try it out! It’s undoubtedly the best tool out there for meeting new guys. I’d just like to add (because it’s happened to all of us), men on here are way more friendly and courteous.

2,1,Grindr on steroids,"Scruff is just Grindr on steroids for some reason. People talk about Grindr guys being creepy and awful, but at least you deal with a wide variety of men. This app just has the worst of the awful guys, the lowest of the low in our community; it’s disgusting. This app is geared towards ‘masculine’ men, although it claims to be inclusive (more on that below), so you get all the toxic masculinity that comes along with it. I have been using this app for about 5 years and I’ve only hooked up twice from it for the first time this year. I’m not going to pretend to be a stud, but I’ve always had much better luck on Grindr. It’s only because the personalities of the guys on Scruff make me want to vomit so I lose interest quickly. Even if just for a quick hook up, it’s still not worth it. The app allows you to write more stuff on your profile than Grindr does, which makes some guys write entire essays about their likes and dislikes and that’s where you start seeing all the racism, and internalized homophobia even more. I could go on for hours writing about the kind of guys that get on the app, but it’s clear they only cater to a very particular audience. The app claims to be inclusive and what not, but even the staff is prejudiced. It’s clear that the good reviews mostly come from the same people who contribute the worst our community has to offer. To top it all off, the same guys will message you on Grindr, but not on Scruff. It makes no sense.",,ih02912,False,2020-12-08 01:09:40,1

You can spend hours reading the profiles and viewing face photos of aspiring young gay men on your Smartphone in the privacy of your home or office. You are allowed to “woof” any man that you might fancy. This is purely your individual choice. You can even contact any of these individuals if their profile offers any interest to you. It is up to the individual you try to contact to message you back. It may be problematic as to whether you receive a message back because that is based on mutual interest of looks, hobbies, business interests and numerous other factors. These factors can be included under the very general term of “chemistry”. The basic plan is free. You are limited on the number of guys you can view. It is still very generous on the number of men you can view. For a nominal monthly fee you can upgrade to the “Pro” plan. With this plan you can view many more gay men along with their profiles as well as message any guy you might want. It is very addictive to browse the guys. It is very entertaining as well. I would highly recommend this app! If you are a gay man I guarantee you will enjoy yourself!","{'id': 7792817, 'body': ""Thanks for your comments! We're happy to hear that you're enjoying SCRUFF.

4,2,"Rude support, not responsive to customer requests","The developer needs to learn that a feature may be working as designed, but if it doesn’t work the way their customers want it to, it’s not working correctly.  Paid version only allows a maximum of 2000 blocks and hides, because (according to Scruff support), more than that causes app performance to degrade unacceptably.  Other dating apps have solved this problem, but Scruff support were adamant that it’s not a problem and therefore they are not going to change how this works.  Instead, they directed me to use their search feature, which also isn’t as robust as it could be, and doesn’t solve the problem I have, which is that the only way to get different guys to show up in my feed is to block or hide the ones who are already shown (so that there is room for other profiles to be displayed).  Again the answer from Scruff support was “this is working as designed and we’re not going to change it.”  These answers would be unacceptable from the company I work for, and pretty much any other company I’ve encountered. This developer needs to learn that their paying customers are their most important customers, and the customer is always right.  Again, “working as designed” is not the same as “working correctly” if it’s not working how your customers want it to.","{'id': 3518424, 'body': 'Your feedback and suggestions are very important.

5,4,Great Guys But That’s Changing,"So this is by far the best app I’ve found to work for me. The guys overall are mellow, it is much more so than Grindr…And silly petty disconnects etc. happen much more in frequently. It is, however, changing at least in the city I live in and that probably has to do with the demographics of our city changing. We have had a lot of people from the West Coast moving in who are used to a different style and pace of life and although we welcome them it’s sad to see the friendliness we’ve been used to and becoming more impatient as well that is way way too specific in the types of guys they are looking for. In fact I think guy types should be much less of a feature than it is. Just like Facebook (Meta🙄), the fewer people we allow into our little world even just for chat, the more specific and less friendly people become when someone outside of their limited preference range tries to say hello.

6,2,Paying member...update ruined experience,"I’ll start w/ saying Scruff for me has easily been one of my favorite hookup/dating apps, both in ease of use, selection of eligible great guys, and features for lying members.  I deleted my Grindr soon after joining as a premium Scruff member because I felt I only ever easily found what I was searching for (with actual follow through) on this app.   But all withstanding, this recent update has been abysmal from a technical perspective.  Woofs and photo unlocks only seem to work half the time, often you have to fully back out of a chat & profile to see a new incoming message, and don’t even get me started on the photo viewing experience.   The best part of premium IMO was the ability to quickly, easily, and fully see a members photo album; to get a better sense of if someone is your type.  But now it is almost a pain to view a members full album.  If you zoom too much or in a slightly careless way, it completely bumps you out of a user’s photo album back to their main profile, sometimes happening over and over.  When you aren’t completely forced out of an album, half the time the zoom feature stops working all together.   And will also frequently bump you to a completely different picture than you were viewing.  It’s a mess to say the least.","{'id': 9247293, 'body': 'We appreciate the feedback regarding SCRUFF 6 updates, and we\'d love to hear from you personally.

Seeing how close some guys are is nice because you can both choose whether or not you want to develop a relationship with someone before you get to know them. 

Something that takes a bit of getting used to though is that the distance that this app shows you is as-the-crow-flys distance. In other words, my boyfriend lives 37 miles away according to the app, but in actuality he’s about an hour’s drive away from me. It might be nice if Scruff utilized Google maps to give you the driving distance instead of what it gives you because it can be misleading. 

I ultimately found the man of my dreams on Scruff and me and my boyfriend now use Scruff to communicate with each other. We also have an agreement that we can flirt with other guys as long as we’re not looking for potential hookups. Scruff has been wonderful. I have met a lot of new friends in addition to finding my new boyfriend. This app has changed my life for the better!","{'id': 8089982, 'body': ""Thanks for your comments!

There are always several popups when you open the app but I expect them and my finger is always ready in the upper right of the screen to immediately close them before they even load completely or before I have to even look at them.  Using the app doesn’t feel like a chore. However, I wish there were more people on it. I have issues with the daily match never showing me anyone local, everyone is over 200 miles away. I sent a support ticket about it and apparently no one that works there has any sort of reading comprehension skills because the response I got back told me I need to change my relationship status to “open relationship” to get better matches. What are you even talking about Bernard from Scruff support? That doesn’t even make sense and my relationship status should have no effect whatsoever on the distance of the matches you send me. This would be less of an issue if you didn’t only get like 10 matches per day but every single days’ matches are always a complete waste.","{'id': 31311109, 'body': 'Thanks for your comments—we\'d love to chat with you directly!

9,1,Nearly the Worst,"These apps are changing peoples interactions, and not for the better. There are studies that people no longer have empathy for other people, and decent people who still believe in treating other people the way they want to be treated, what used to be called common courtesy, or driven off sites like this in droves as the bad behavior of others becomes the norm, and made acceptable by scruff thanks to no consequences. I told someone off for their bad behavior and I was the one who got the warning from scruff, not them. That's perfectly normal behavior for scruff and me deciding not to be a doormat is not. Then they want me too pay for premium scruff, meaning premium abuse, nonstop. when scruff adds a means of the community voting on the people using their app so actions have consequences just like in real life, then it would be worth considering. Its insides are also messed up. They would lead you to believe that you're only interested in certain types, but the reality is what it's measuring is your reaction to those types writing to you in the first place..

10,5,Three reason... +1,"I dislike the amount of people that use scruff. That’s it, truthfully, I can’t thing of any other grievances.

At first glance the interface is wonky (Being that all gay boys start on Grindr). 
However, Scruff has amazing capabilities! Everything I could ever ask for in an app of this sort is there, it’s very well thought out. 
Some of my favorite things are the private photo albums •You can quickly catch a guys attention by unlocking, rather than a nearly invisible ‘hey’•The human body is art, one should capture it is ways that communicate that and share often•
I also love the fact that you can jot quick notes about someone for yourself •I don’t have PRO at the moment but this would be something I’d us after every conversation•He likes/dislikes... Don’t talk to him he... *giggles*•
Lastly I enjoy the match sectioning the app •I think it’s super cutesy•It keeps me coming back just about every day, there aren’t very many profiles that catch my attention in my area [What can I say, I’m out of their leagues]•It’s an awesome way to see profiles that I do not come by on a day to day bases•

Okay, okay, okay; This is really the last one. The ability to search lNo need to elaborate•

Truthfully Grindr gets more attention than it deserves and I wish more people would use scruff. Pleeeaasssss make it happen some how!!! But only allow the men... I like men not boys...

11,5,So much better than Grindr!,"I have used Scruff nearly for ten years! I have nothing but positive compliments about the company. And it’s not only in comparison to Grindr, who is awful. Scruff’s professionalism is evident in their quality of the app and customer dedication. With scruff I have encountered the following :
- dedicated customer support
- a response in a timely fashion 
- a follow on customer/product request
- a follow on abuser reporting 
- service dependability, as for example messages being delivered by either parties, sender(s)/receiver(s)
- a human connections when following on on issue 
- relatable advertising, no Christian mingle or similar no sense. Just product that enhances the livelihood of our community LGTBQ community! No just anyone buying/selling something. 
I don’t give this praise because I despite Grindr’s platform so much, I know quality when I see it. I can’t wait to see Scruff’s market value and presence exceeds that of overrated Grindr. I would be more happy paying Scruff’s extra service in comparison to unlimited blocks and whatever other nonsense that comes with “Xtra”. 
* I don’t and never have been employed by Scruff, nor was I compensated in anyway for this review. I enjoy there product and service and will continue to be their valued customer, just as they remember who their real customers are.

 The guys on here are just duplicates of nearly every other app. And since there aren’t as many here is there are another apps, you have more success elsewhere. Wow I get hundreds of messages, many of them from all across the world, I’ve only met a handful of people in those eight years. Ultimately, the app has been suffering a lot of bugs and glitches in the past few months. The developers are great. Yet the glitches that I run into are beyond annoying. Even when I try to submit feedback using the app for why I deleted my profile, the app kept sending me back into the feedback form. I could never even submit it. That’s my point. Add to that the constant messages I get that say my messages were not delivered even though someone is responding to them… it’s a very niche app. The user base is smaller than others, and generally I think friendlier. It just feels more like a penpal app than anything else. A big factor for me is a limit on blocks.

14,5,Scruff is Great But!!,"Scruff changed several methods of filtering and blocking in wanted messages. 

I wish you could set up the app to where when we set up our profiles we only see similar attributes so if I set my profile to Single because I am then when I go to Global I want to see only the single guys Not married not Polyamory not Dating 

Also if you had more than Global and New maybe have chat rooms where we could then access to do group chat by state, city or continental region. For that matter have one for singles by city married by city.  

Need more than seeing everyone it’s too much and doesn’t allow one person to use the app like we want from it. 

I’ve met you guys in NYC several years ago and asked me my opinion back then and I told you that I love what your doing so nothing At the moment comes to mind.  

But now I’m starting to see several needs.

The bar scene is gone and now this is it.  So now let’s take it to the next step and create the retro bar scene in Scruff with streaming video chat with Video Bars for men with certain ages.  

I would love to see you take a FaceTime approach where if you were in a chat and wanted to real-time chat you could.

Customer service is responsive (and quickly). Profiles have freedom for more detail.  The only change I’d make would be a face requirement and profile verification to weed out posers using fake pics. I never have issues with ridiculous cartoon ads for childish games. I never get spammed or scammed. Grindr needs to up their game.

Also, I subscribed to the pro version and on the same day (within the same minute actually) my profile got suspended for no apparent reason. I’m assuming these are unrelated but I wrote to support and haven’t gotten a real response, just things shuffled about for the past two days. Hope it’s not the case that they let me upgrade on an account that was suspended as I literally was locked out right after I hit the upgrade button. Even worse would be that the upgrade set some automation that triggered something suspicious that caused the suspension. Seems like a simple investigation but still no reply.","{'id': 22604536, 'body': 'If you received an alert for the suspension of your profile, please tap the “Request Review” button in the alert to open a support ticket.

So I decided to ""decline"" and found I couldn't enter he app. Contacted Scruff regarding some sort  of refund for the balance of my subscription and they said they couldn't do anything and to contact Apple. I chatted with Apple support and explained my situation, but Apple has a No Refund After Two Months policy. I asked them what I should do and they said to contact the developer. ..the runaround...

The first features are important so you don’t unintentionally harass someone that you may have forgotten you woofed or viewed, while the second removes the ability for people to match with other singles. I have no problems with couples or partnered people being on the app, but a lot of guys are looking for their own relationships, even if this is primarily hookup oriented. Opening the match to everyone makes it harder to find another single person. I think a lot of the recent updates are unnecessary and make the app worse.

That wasn’t as big a deal when the quality of the app made up for it, but now now that it doesn’t offer anything not already done better by competitors (and in some ways does even less) it’s hard to see the point of Scruff.

Changing fonts usually means you’re running out of innovation. Apple does this every release now. 

Put the chat and woof buttons back to the right side.  It’s bad and difficult as it is now. 

Probably no one asked for the way too large images sizes. Might want to survey that along with many other “ways things are” in the app. 

Navigation is improved in some places but very much worse in others. 
The buttons at the bottom were better on the side. 
Having the favs button at bottom now means that you have to make effort to get to your top fav favs. Before you just moved slightly into the top of your list. Now you have to move all the way to top of screen. 
In mobile usage, this is extremely bad. 

Been needing a link to see the entire profile for a long time now in Match. 

I don’t think the Global view should default to latest online.  Most people aren’t looking for just whatever has popped up.  Enable most woof’d to be at top.

I’ve also encountered too many creeps and predators on this app. Typically I block them and move on. However, the app creators decided it would be a good idea to limit the amount of users that can be blocked?

Pro- I noticed with Scruff that the app works VERY well. Smooth, never crashes, and the functionality of the entire app is amazing. I haven’t experienced any issues with it. 

Cons: I don’t like how the majority of the app has “older” guys. I’m 23 years old and I am not interested in 40-50 year olds messaging me. Secondly, I don’t like that you don’t have any flexibility with filtering the “age”of the guys you wanna talk too. You NEED to have the “pro” version compared to Grindr you don’t.

Besides other complaints of racist profile picture screening that I myself experienced, this app does nothing but reinforce the worst parts of the gay community (racism, femme shaming, body shaming, transphobia). I was told this app was more accepting and overall friendlier and safer than Grindr, but after using it I laugh at the comparison. The app itself is easy to use, discreet and well-designed, but until Scruff can diversify and ACTUALLY contribute something to making the LGBTQ community an accepting place, I won’t be using it. 👎🏼","{'id': 14514017, 'body': 'We appreciate the feedback, and we\'d love to hear from you personally.

1073,3,It’s a finite clientele,"Thought I’d give a new review. Old one is further below. 

Current version works well enough. 
New feature of going straight to chat, I’m not a fan. Would really like to see who sent the message first. Then decide whether to read it. 
I feel this app is missing out on an opportunity, a BFF feature. All this time during the lockdown, people had a difficult time meeting up. It was difficult for making new friends as well. Many felt isolated. How wonderful it would have been to have a social/make new friends section similar to Bumble’s BFF.  That feature for them is all the craze right now. I know I’m enjoying it. 
Anyway my two cents worth. 
Also, how does one become an ambassador? I see this all the time. Not sure what that feature is about. 

……
Even though it’s one of the better apps, it keeps trying to be grindr. Which is a horrible app. The uptake in adds is sad. I get it. You need make money, but it can be done in a less intrusive way. Lose a star The new Beta Bear mode is a why would you want to narrow down your clientele like that. It already mostly swinger bears. Will there be an otter mode, swingers mode, looking for just friends mode etc. and what steep price will you ask for it? It’s the same local people over and over. Yawn. Its also the same people in all the other categories. It’s a finite clientele. I’ve been in this app since it first appeared. And it’s quite pricy. Yikes! Part of me just says ‘why?’. People would actually pay to see the same 100, 200 guys in there feed on a daily basis.

1074,1,Poor Customer Support!,"First off every time they update the app it becomes less appealing! It is nothing like it use to be and a lot of great features have been taken away. Secondly, if you aren’t in your 20s or have an Adonis body be ready to have your pics scrutinized by their moderators! I submitted a picture that shows barely 2” of underwear fabric just above a mirror frame and it was rejected. When I contested it through there customer support, which is what you’re directed to do if you feel it’s rejected in error, I was dismissed and told never to use support again unless it’s serious. I sent pictures along with my complaint of other approved profiles with guys full body underwear pictures, semi-hard, full outlines and pubic hair showing but of cours about 10 years younger and off the cover of a magazine or clearly packing a monster. I was told to go report them, not the point! I even went as far to reach out to both Eric Silverburg and Johnny Skandros themselves about their customer support and bias handling with their policies, nothing. I’ve never reached out to the CEO and founders of a business and had them act as if they could care less about their paying customers. I’ve been a member since Scruffs infancy and a paying member for most of it. About to lose one more for poor customer service, all for absolutely ridiculous reasons!

***UPDATE***The response to the issue of poor customer support is to contact customer support about customer support. I some how don’t thank Daniel O is going to do anything about his own customer service skills or correct the issue I’ve already contacted him multiple times about. Why should he care to act any different when the CEO and founder seem to not care and this is the kind of response that a bad review gets on the App Store?

***UPDATE 2.0*** Contacted Scruff Support AGAIN because that’s what the Developer said to do, though I’m sure I was probably complaining to Daniel O about Daniel O. My ticket went days being ignored and then was just closed with no response. Can I give negative stars?","{'id': 17704317, 'body': 'We appreciate the feedback, and we\'d love to hear from you personally.

1125,1,Latest update is unavailable for older iPhones,"Scruff keeps pushing me to update, constantly throwing up ads that force me over to the App Store and even going as far as disabling photo viewing (even though I'm a premium member and therefore paying for the right to view photos). The problem, however, is that Scruff version 6.0 requires you have iOS 11.0 on your phone and that iOS is not available on the iPhone 5 (which I have) or older versions of the iPhone. Therefore, I have to choose between  buying a new phone so I can use all of the premium benefits on Scruff or terminating my premium membership. I'm going to terminate my premium membership. I like Scruff but it's not worth throwing down $600-$900 on a new phone just to keep using it, and if I can't use all of the premium benefits then there is no point in paying for a premium membership.

 I have already contacted support, explained that I kept getting pop up messages demanding I upgrade to Scruff 6.0 and that I couldn't do that because the required iOS is not available for my iPhone. I also mentioned that I could not see any photo galleries. Their only response was ""Well you need to update to Scruff 6.0."" 

What?!? I just told you I can't update to Scruff 6.0 and your response is to tell me I should update to Scruff 6.0?

This used to be a great app, but this is just messed up. I guess I will terminate my Pro membership and stop using Scruff if this is how it's going to be. I can't afford a new phone right now and I certainly couldn't justify the expense solely to keep using Scruff","{'id': 10214925, 'body': 'We appreciate the feedback.

1129,1,No integrity,"Unfortunately, their new picture decency “policy” makes them very big hypocrites. I was flagged for having a picture in a pair of boxer brief trunks cut mid-thigh length; very model like, classy and hardly distasteful. They sited this as being in violation of their new underwear “policies” but allow plenty of other guys to post speedo and speedo looking underwear pics - far skimpier; and they are not flagged. They are not removed. If Scruff is going to have such a stringent new bikini briefs and speedo policy they need to triple the enforcement of it - why do some guys get to keep pics up in their briefs while removing others? And who decides? Algorithms? Someone at a desk in India? This is a very troublesome new policy. Let’s not even get started on how slow, robotic and disingenuous their Support structure is. 

Then, I replace the photo with a shirtless bathroom mirror selfie. Nothing hanging “out” and nothing creeping - and they again remove it. No specific reason. No notification. They just take my photo off. Again, who decides who’s picture goes and who’s can stay? Even more troublesome is if it’s a human being behind a desk why does he/she keep some user’s pics while others must go. Completely hypocritical with a biased sense of subjectivity. 

If you are a paid Pro member you get treated like this - Support is not in a hurry to get back to me. Nor would I imagine they really would be. All I got was a canned form letter telling me they’re “on it”.  Sure. 

I cancelled my paid  Pro membership subscription and will remove my profile contents shortly. I’m sorry it has to end this way; but if this is how they treat paying, subscribing customers then I want no part. My hard earned dollar will go to Bro or Grindr.","{'id': 7957245, 'body': 'We appreciate the feedback, and we\'d love to hear from you personally to address your concerns.

1140,4,"Works for me; others, not so sure","I updated the minute the new versions became available. The new features were a great improvement in my opinion. As I am already a Pro member, I was not aware of all the restrictions that have been placed on non-paying members. I read through the other reviews and think that something needs to be done, but since it doesn't directly apply to me, I hesitate to get on a soap box. It would just be a shame to make a connection on the app, only to discover that I can't use any of the features I already pay for because the other person doesn't pay. As for the interface, I think it's fine. It's familiar. The only feature I still think needs to be added is an indicator on a member's profile (like coloring the button orange like the unlock icon) showing that you have woofed at a person before. If you decide to woof at then again, it would also be nice if the confirmation dialog could tell you when you last woofed. It is impossible to go through your list if ""Woof'd At""s to check this out. Still think this app is moving in the right direction; maybe just needs to work out a few kinks.",,SenorSegway,False,2013-06-23 19:19:35,3

That's just one of the new items added, so many new little short cuts that make this app so much better than any of the competition. The attitude of the guys seem to be getting better and a little more likely to respond than other apps even if not interested. Important to have in a really successful app for it to do its best in getting guys to meet each other. It's not always about a hook up. It can be a conversation that leads to a friendship or something of interest with that person, that then leads you to a hook up or date with someone else you find attractive that only would have happened thru that initial person. Isn't that where the best connections happen, those hard to find guys.
Does everyone have too many friends to meet any others? Having a beer with someone that you wouldn't normally have, will probably make more of a change in your prospective hook ups or dates, then the guys you see all the time. You never know who they know that may be of interest to you and vice versus.

I'm all for Scruff making $$ for this app, but .20 per picture being paid between sender & receiver? Bandwidth is not that expensive!  You should only charge the person saving the received retina pic, not the person sending it! 

Also why try to play games with credits? Just make it simple to understand... 10 credits for .99 cents... Why try and hide the cost by saying 750 credits for .99 and then charge 75 credits to send a pic?  Also the extra ""plus"" features for $4.99 & $3.99 are too much.. I would pay a max of $2.50 each for those features.  I'm not paying $8.98 a month AND then also pay .10 to send a retina pic and .10 cents to save a received retina pic.. You will get more subscribers if you dropped each of those to $2.50/mo max, and if you subscribe to both, give maybe enough credits to send & receive 50 pics per month...

This latest version has some needed improvements made but apparently the people at Scruff got inflated egos and WAY WAY WAY overpriced the added features that you can purchase on monthly subscription basis that make the app usable. For example if you want to see more than a few handful of subscribers pay $3.99. If you want to see a history of your conversation with someone more than the last few texts to him, pay for an additional $3.99 - really?  Two separate subscription fees - Nearly $10 per month when said and done just to make the app usable?  One flat $3.99 fee is steep but doable for most. Two subscription fees is just ridiculous!

Grindr has very minimal  space in their profiles and only tells you when you've got a message if you have the app open, even then it only does that maybe 75% of the time. End result, with Scruff you get to socialize more and check you phone less. Grindr seems to be more popular because it came first and it gives the illusion of having more users on the screen. If you have nothing better to do than constantly check and refresh some app for slow paced chatting/trying to meet some dude who's phone might die any minute or enjoy looking flakey and rude because you've got better things to do with your time and battery life, choose Grindr.

1152,5,The Little Gay Web App that 'Woofed',"Scruff is hands down one of the best social networking architectures out there supporting a niche community.  This category is full of wannabes and Scruff isn't the first of its kind to be sure.  It is quite simply the best app all-around for its membership. The service is a bit pricey, I think at almost $20/month.  (I mean does that include a gym membership or what, right?  Ah, nope.) But believe it or not, that's a competitive price.  

Interestingly, I feel this category of social networking experiences may be the vanguard for how social networks evolve for the Internet as a whole.  It's worth paying attention to these niche communities and how brands like Scruff play to essentially tribal affiliations to produce both ad-sales revenue, and evergreen membership fees, that are to a great extent inoculated against encroachment by Facebook.  In the Internet echo system , this service has found a niche that may have it competing against (or being eaten up by) some much bigger players.",,Withershine,False,2015-11-28 18:24:14,4
1153,4,History Lesson,"I just downloaded the latest update for Scruff. Overall I'm a fan of this app, and the new ""Grids"" feature is a nice improvement. But I wonder if anyone on the programming or management staff remembers that ""GRID"" was one of the names initially given to the disease that would eventually be known as AIDS.  It was called Gay Related Immune Deficiency, and that name reflected, in part, the ugly stigma that is still attached to that terrible plague: that gay people were somehow to blame or deserving of the suffering caused by AIDS/HIV. Now I'm not saying they should change the app or this feature, but in future upgrades and features the staff may want to consider their audience. There are, no doubt, some of our more mature scruffy brothers on the sight who lost friends to AIDS.  I know our community tends to focus on fashion in the here-and-now, but I think we could afford to reflect on our history more often, lest we forget and end up back where we were when GRID was just appearing.",,Scruffy Muffin,False,2012-07-14 13:17:34,3

It's got fantastic features and really good add value for pro members, the app is always reliable and there are never bots. Once you use Scruff it seems amazing Grindr has an user base at all. In addition to great features and reliability, the app tends to attract articulate, educated men which is another way it trumps the competition. I suppose it's a self fulfilling prophecy --scruff never limits your to 140 characters and because of that you get it all from hookups to dates. Big fan!

The new app update took some getting used to and there are some features that are now buried or hard to find at all. But they've already released an update with marked improvements and it seems like they are taking user feedback into account.

They went from a really outdated version 4 (which didn't support iPhone 6 for over a year, but yet they had Apple Watch support?) to this amazing refresh which has way more functionality. Most impressive is the ability to use the app in landscape mode. The new views (who's online, most woof'd) look great. Tap and hold to instantly start a chat, ingenious!! Let's compare:

Grindr: requires a premium subscription to get basic features such as notifications, loaded with spam users, the app crashes constantly. 

Growlr: when it first arrived it was simple and fast, and at one time I was a Pro user. Now it's plagued by obtrusive ads/videos and the developers have done little to make it better. The more you use it, the more the creators are making money off you from the ads, and it's obvious. Worse, the quality of picture uploads is poor, making your first impression lacking.

Hornet: Ad placement is poor making your experience less enjoyable. You'll receive lots of annoying messages from the 'support team'. The app itself is clunky in some areas, and photo resolution changes after viewing others in the same profile.

Jack'd: Way too many complaints from users, not worth your time.

The interface, profile options, and easy communication have always been the best of any app out there. Most recent update is ok -- the new interface is more cluttered than I would like, it's less seamless to navigate between albums and profiles, and a lot of features were changed that didn't need changing, like the use of icons instead of words for some buttons. I'm disappointed with the new censorship of profiles: my profile was flagged for inappropriate context because is said NO PNP (flagged the word ""PNP""). The censorship script should be more intelligent than that. And the profile text is scrunched too narrowly -- an otherwise short profile now requires lots of scrolling, and those with lots of descriptive text now have to severely cut down if anyone is going to read what they have to say.

1159,1,Poorly conceived,"I am a professional iOS developer. This update is like a parody of what I do: rather than reading and absorbing the Human Interface Guidelines, the app authors seem to have taken the stance that an app has the look and feel of the OS simply because it uses vibrancy effects and custom view controller transitions. Most of which are poorly executed with jerky frame updates in the completion block. The navigation structure is senseless; instead of proper stacking of view controllers, there are unnecessary modals with Done buttons. These are the least of its sins: the main screens for browsing have simply gone haywire with clutter and irrelevance. Icons have replaced text for no good reason in many places. The only real improvement I see is more seamless pagination.

Sadly, I suspect the following: most likely, the owner was led to believe his app required a top-down makeover and rewrite. This exercise was likely very expensive. Most of the old UI tropes could have been elegantly updated and modernized for the new OS features without so much rework.

 Although it's aimed at a more muscle-bear/meat and potatoes kind of guy, it doesn't come across as ""exclusive"". I like the option to ""woof"" at guys; it's a nice way to compliment a guy without being pushy or having to have a conversation. Another nice feature is the ""would you meet"" button. If both of you choose ""maybe"" or ""yes"", it suggests that you both initiate a conversation. It doesn't alert them if you choose ""no"", so both parties are spared negative perceptions.

That said, the monthly $9 ""subscription"" is highway robbery for unlocking features that are, by and large, standard functionalities in Scruff's competitors.  I mean, having to pay to block more than 80 profiles? Or being able to see your full message history with another user?  If you're going to charge a whopping $100+ per year for a subscription, the extras you get for it oughta be AMAZING.  Conversely, if I'm paying a monthly charge for enabling a feature set that brings Scruff up to (and perhaps even a bit above) the functionality level of its competition, then the charge ought to be on par with that of the competition.

What really sets Scruff aside from the other apps (like A4A and Grindr) is that Scruff has incorporated the 'would you be interested in meeting this person' and the extension of 'the Stack' where Scruff randomly selects profiles from the thousands around the world and you say if you would be interested or not.  If there's an indicated interest from both parties, you are alerted and it's then up to you to make contact.  

The other new features for this version of the Scruff app is the 'who's online, New Members, Who got Woofed the Most; Most Woofed New Member and Who's Online Now Globally/Locally.  Previously it was just who was online now gloves and local.  These new sections allows you to see more guys' profile than before.

The connectivity issues do seem to be a bit to constant for my taste. 

There also seems to be way to many steps to have to go through to see: images, messages, woofs, viewers....

This is a mobile app so I would think the idea of getting to what you needed would be a little more streamlined.

I haven't upgraded to any of the extra features and have been happy I haven't due to yesterday's outage and the constant connectivity issues. From the other reviews I am also getting the idea that they charge a bit more then any other gay social apps, how does that bode for competition? I don't understand why they are charging a fee to see your back log of chats, so maybe the other negative reviewers are correct in saying someone got greedy...

I've been a paid member for going on two years now. I pay because it makes it easier to communicate with non-pro members as well as pro members. When a social app like this begins to segregate the paid members it devalues the paid feature set. Increasing the difficultly for any member to interact with a non paid member is a tactic for increasing sales that alludes to a lack of new ideas on the developers end. Paying for scruff allows me to have larger private albums -- I am not interested in this feature if not everyone can view the albums I create.

The guys on there are also just generally the right combination between nice, interesting, hot, and sleezy, and I'm much more likely to be actual friends with someone from there.

Profiles have a bit more space and direction to talk about both dating/hookup interests and less sleezy stuff, and are easier to narrow down than the other gay apps.

A few things that big me though:
You can't scroll back in message histories. I get that you can pay money for that, but as someone who is young/conventionally hot enough not to need to pay for hookup apps, it puts me in situations where I forget a guy's name because I can't scroll back. I get that saving a backlog of pics maybe is too expensive, but saving the text part would be nice.

I also wish they sent push notifications for woofs, not just messages, because I often miss woofs guys send me for several days. The push notifications have been messed up lately anyway, they will not show a banner saying I have messages so I won't check and then will find I missed someone hot who wanted to hook",,jackrad,False,2014-03-11 13:10:57,4
1175,3,Awesome but w/ huge caveat,"This is actually (kinda) the best among all the gay men's dating/hook-up sites but it comes with one major fault: you can only display one pic publicly at a time. That's mindless because someone might see a guy they're somewhat interested in but they only have one pic to decide to pursue it further or not. Jack'd let's one put up 3 pics PLUS the option of 2 private pics if one chooses to. I would give that one 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that so few men join it and it feels like Groundhog Day every time you look at the selections. Can't understand why more men wouldn't be flocking to Jack'd. But, Scruff has much going for it except that big Achile's heel. Maybe some out there is actually paying attention and will implement the simple feature of letting the guys know the full portrait of their prospective date. Sorta makes sense, huh?",,brickellrich,False,2012-04-16 11:21:52,4
1176,4,Love the new features,"Very pleased with the rate of improvements to this app. It's currently the only one of its kind I use (ditched Grindr). I love filtering on community (though too many people are delusional about which communities they actually belong in--filter on ""Muscle"" and see what I mean), I love being able to organize albums and favorites better than before. I love the way it notifies you of new woofs and album unlockings.

I've met a lot of people in the real world by meeting first online, and how do you put a price on friendships? Yes, I will keep in touch with many of them for a long time to come. So this app has paid for itself repeatedly.

Update: the program has, after recent updates, been positively harassing me to rate it, and pestering me with notifications. I lowered my rating. Happy now, jerks?",,DC_bear,False,2013-08-28 11:36:25,5
1177,1,Alright and slipping...,"The app is continually freezing on my 6+, and taking inordinate amounts of time to load.  My WiFi signal is great, and my 5S has had little difficulty loading SCRUFF and images; much faster than my 6+.  Perhaps an update?!  

SCRUFF is pricy, and for the quality of guys who are generally found, I have remained a basic user because the app has not demonstrated the worth of purchasing.  Also, I have noticed that more and more basic features are being taken away (over the last year or so) so that users, who want those very features to remain, will have to succumb to a forced purchase.

Chiseled bodies (there's only so many 'good body genes' out there, and they're not the majority), ""top"", ""bottom"", ""hung"" and ""cross fit"" (or ""xxfit"") have been well demonstrated to perpetuate the divisiveness of the homo subculture through SCRUFF.  Realizing that we all have preferences, but we're also in the same canoe with paddles, and if we're not paddling in unison, we're not going to get far.",,shaykmitchell,False,2016-11-23 20:48:38,2
1178,1,When good apps go bad...,"Scruff was a phenomenal app when it was first released. Good support of the community and a decent, if not great, interface.  Over time the interface improved, more guys started using the app, and Scruff started sponsoring community events. Things looked promising for the future.

Somewhere, though, the developers made some bad decisions. Deciding to charge out-of-touch high prices for piecemeal functionality is one such decision. Attempting to force such changes on the user base is another. Refusing to acknowledge just how disappointed that user base has become is yet another bad decision. 

Scruff has an opportunity to change course, but it will take some re-evaluation on their part. If they really want to support and embrace the communities the app was made popular by, Scruff needs to prove it. Otherwise, the developers simply come across as more concerned with milking money from their user base than actually improving their app's functionality and appeal.",,Ulkesh,False,2012-02-21 23:31:53,2
1179,1,Used to be just ok...,"You know that nearby mall that at one point was pretty cool, but now it's 75% vacant and the only patrons are scary people, and a few normal ones that wandered in accidentally because they thought it would be much better?  Scruff is like that mall. 

The interface is awful... Clunky, claustrophobic, ugly, hard to figure out. 
The majority of the guys on there seem just as bad. If you want to get bombarded with lame, one-word openers (""hey"", ""grr"", ""stud"", ""sup?"") by guys who aren't smart enough or don't care enough to scroll down & read a few lines of text in a profile (and of course have either no profile pic, or a shot of their nipple, eye, or other random body part), then this is the app for you!
Oh, and to fully appreciate the true magic of the experience, be sure to pay by the month for it, so you can feel extra duped for wasting your time downloading the app and trying to figure out basic functions within the plethora of icons & buttons everywhere on the screen. 

Oh, and if you DO pay, please notice that the subscription renews automatically. It does notify you of that with one of the MANY pop-up windows that randomly appear, but the method of unsubscribing isn't in the settings menu as the window says (it's not a button you turn on/off)... It's a link to the iTunes Store that's buried in the terms of service that you have to hunt for.",,CS0472,False,2012-10-23 13:54:51,1
1180,4,Dominated by partnered guys,"This is a great app but I've noticed that many of the guys list their status as partnered, in a relationship, married, etc. No judgment but it's a bit frustrating if you're a single guy and you're trying to meet other single guys. I feel like I'm at a couples retreat or something.  It would be nice if the app allowed you to only see or be seen by single people. Half of the messages I receive are from guys in relationships. My profile says I'm not into partnered guys but I guess they don't bother to read the text. Other than all that, this app has the best design and best features of any gay dating app I've used. It handily beats Grindr, Growlr, Hornet, and Mr X; those apps all pale in comparison to Scruff when it comes to features, reliability, visual design, etc.",,Me04660,False,2015-06-08 16:36:52,3
1181,5,For mature audiences only,"There are several things about Scruff that I like. To begin with I'll state that I was using Grindr before and I had just about lost faith in gay people over it. Then I discovered Scruff and I have restored hope. For whatever reason, this app draws in more mature men (not just in age, but mentality). On top of this huge upgrade from Grindr, it has great features: woofs let guys know you think they're hot and helps ease into conversation rather than sending that arbitrary ""hey."" The ""I'm interested"" feature is great for deciding whether you should pursue further relations with someone or if you're howling at the wind. And notifications are great so you don't leave potential prospects hanging for days only to find they've moved on. Love it.",,SpikeXed,False,2015-11-24 07:22:37,5
1182,5,Best functionality...,"I love that my profile is synced automatically among all devices. Also, being able to see viewers and share albums without paying extra is very nice. Overall, scruff has the best coverage and usage across north america by a kinder class of users, and ease of functionality among all the gay social-networking apps, from my experience. Friendlier group of users, especially compared to Grindr(all attitude) and manhunt(judge not lest ye be judged...). Growlr still has the most respectful and friendly cross-section of men, but not as wide a selection, and doesn't sync well between devices. My biggest wish is that Scruff would have a website that non-app users could use and participate in the fun, like Adam4Adam.",,9x5,False,2013-05-05 18:11:45,5
1183,2,Dropping the ball,"This app was a Godsend when I first downloaded it. I was over the Grindr gays and wanted some real guys to talk to. Flirt with. What have you. But every update seems to not only increase the price for a membership, but decrease the accessibility and features of the app itself. It's getting way too complicated. There are so many gratuitous features, and you now have to pay to use the basic features that made this app so great in the first place (private albums without restrictions, more profile loads, etc.). This app really helped me find great guys to talk to and it had a great sense of community. And instead of continuing to stand apart, Scruff has chosen to conform to the norm and care more about making money than providing a service to gay men. Based on the Facebook page, it seems the money from this app is only going toward funding the party lifestyle of the app creators. It's sad.",,carsonbetz,False,2013-06-24 05:09:54,2
1184,4,Better than most gay apps,"I like the many different features of this app, mainly the amount of space per profile. With others like Grindr & etc, you only have a limited amount of space to write what defines yourself and what you're looking for. I also like the insights into their profiles; how frequent guys are to responding, what their sexual safety preferences are and what kind of men they go after, as well as the locations searches and pretty much most of the app. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because to access the entire app, it's pretty expensive per month, which I get that's how they make money but overall that doesn't deter me from giving them a low score, so yes 4 stars is pretty great for an app like this!",,Trzepacz,False,2016-03-14 22:46:58,4
1185,3,Very very slow with tons bugs so far!,"The 3 stars is because I love all the cool guys on here. It's a million times better than the guys on Grindr but the program has so many bugs and is so slow! The keyboard is so slow I spend half my time fixing typing errors because half the letters don't show up and you have to type SO SLOW! I wish there were sounds when you receive a message instead of just a silent notification. I find myself hitting refresh on the message screen so much because it loads so slow, doesn't always save guys in favorites and sometimes says guys who live in my neighborhood are 5k miles away. Le sigh. Worth the price tag tho. Who can really complain when it's free but I'd pay a small amount for all these things to be fixed permanently.",,SpencerChase,False,2010-09-25 20:59:17,3
1186,5,Horrible Decision!,"What was once a great service, has now become a huge rip-off! While I understand the need to charge, I don't agree with the ridiculous $8.98 per month fee, to use features that cost far less on other apps. This boils down to greed! I subscribed for one month to try it out, and it already has glitches. As for their claim that ""Everything that was free before is still free"" claim, I call bull. I could block people for free before, and now you have to pay to do so. Even then, the block feature doesn't work!! Rather than paying $5 for this, $4 for that & ""credits"", they should have ONE fee for everything and not exceed $5!!!   Back to Jack'd & Grindr for me.",,TX-IAN,False,2011-08-19 12:54:38,1
1187,4,Works great but I think pro is too expensive,"I like the larger size grids with the latest release. I think that's the only thing I really do like about the newest version. I preferred the more specific indication of how long ago a user viewed your profile rather than a range like less the 2 hours, past day, past two days, etc.  And why are you gouging the gay community so much for the pro version?  I've been paying for it for some time it's twice as much as growlers pro version and I am considering downgrading. The additional features do not justify the additional cost in y opinion. People like to feel like they're getting their money's worth and I'm not really sure that I am with the pro version.",,blkbtmnsf,False,2016-01-28 07:54:14,3
1188,3,pretty good,"I'd like to see a pay-subscription that's ad free. I'd also like to see the nav buttons easier to hit, and locked in a frame at the top instead of floating/scrolling. it'd be nice to have the refresh button at the top. also, a full photo gallery would be a nice addition for the paid subscription members. the chat input is clunky and slow, and often words become misspelled. it's difficult to double-tap into the chat screen. also there's no quick way to get right to the pic. that's what I want to see. 

outside of that, this app runs pretty well. I find a lot of the chats get lost, and your session expires after an hour. and the profile views expire after a day. if you don't fav people, you're liable to lose contact with them permanently.",,mdconnell,False,2010-08-14 12:30:35,3
1189,4,"decent, could use a few improvements","better than grindr, that's for sure (especially in the battery drain department).  getting to messages is a bit of a messy 3 step process.  no real notification system if guys mutually are interested or if you get 'woofed' at.  you've got to somehow figure that out for yourself, I guess.  somewhat slow to refresh at times.  and the in app keyboard is slow and doesn't seem to auto correct properly.  DESPITE all this, it's a great app and I like it more than the more fleshed out grindr.  this app isn't a battery sucker and seems to just close when you exit.  GREAT!  i'd like to see a few improvements.  but it's pretty decent as is.",,Music Sounds Better With You!,False,2011-06-07 02:20:17,4

The, say, weekly BUY SCRUFF PRO pop up is largely nothing more than a minor nuisance. But I strongly suggest that you buy it because I don't want to but I still want the app to be great and their coders need to eat and stuff.",,VirQuisqueVir,False,2016-12-20 04:12:04,4
1191,5,AT LAST,"This version is the best so far. Previous versions have been frustrating with lost favorites and messages freezing. Seems to be better so far. Love the new interface. Nice to be able to tell if a guy is online. I hope they come up with a pay version with more filters such as age, location, friend, hook-up, and LTR. It would be nice if they had a ""cut or uncut"" option. Everyone says this Is a hook-up app but I think it's for whatever you want it to be. So many guys get angry about what this app is for. It is the best app and man tool available. Thanks guys for making such an amazing app possible for all of us to enjoy. I'm truly grateful!!!",,appleman59,False,2015-04-29 22:12:34,5
1192,5,Love this app!! Best app out there for men!,"Only two things I wish they would add..  Would really like to be able to add a note to the profiles of guys I chat with so that I can remember their names since so many guys only put a single letter as their name or use some really off the wall profile name. 
Also would be great if I could rate the guys I chat with..  Maybe a five star system or something like that. 
Other than that I have absolutely no complaints. They are constantly providing updates for speed and stability!  The Scuff team is awesome and are very active in the community as well. Love me some Johnny Scruff!!",,Chad Bienvenu,False,2012-01-06 19:16:48,4
1193,1,New version to reset bad reviews,"I used to like Scruff. But it seems as if they are issuing ‘bug fixes’ to push a new version into the store and to get rid of bad reviews. What has really gotten me is somehow they’ve gotten the app through the App Developer rules with making the ability to use TouchID to unlock the app a paid, in-app purchase. How can a developer make money off a hardware feature they had no input into creating. I’ve lodged a complaint with Apple. Developers should not be allowed to make money off hardware. They are free to restrict their own content to in-app purchases. If you allow Scruff and others to start making money off Apple’s hardware features then where does it stop? Maybe a streaming music app will start charging more money to allow you to control the volume button on your device. This is the road Scruff is going down.",,lipseyt,False,2016-05-06 17:42:24,1
1194,5,Has always worked well for me,"Not sure what all the recent complaints are about. I've had the app since shortly after it updated to v5. Has always worked great. Nice interface. Easy to use and read. I've never had issues with crashes. Notifications for chatting and other things are included in the free version, which is a big deal. It beats Grindr in every way, except there aren't quite as many guys on it. Probably because it's a little more ""upscale"" in its quality and seems more geared toward guys that want to actually get to know each other, with more extensive profiles, pics, and chatting.",,Skyhunter27,False,2016-06-20 19:00:03,3
1195,5,Good App,"I use the Scruff Pro version and have found that I like it much more than Grindr, especially when talking with people locally. Overall, the app design is better and more responsive, which is why I don't mind paying for it. It has its quirks, but what software doesn't? Interestingly, I have found members of Scruff to be more responsive than on Grindr and I have spoken with people both near and far (something Grindr was not designed to do, so comparing the two in some sense is not apples to apples). Overall, it's a good app, and though a little pricey, it's worth paying a monthly fee to get the features found in the Pro version.",,b_imzadi,False,2014-06-07 10:27:00,3
1196,5,Best Designed of This Type of App,"As a former software products manager, I know what goes into the design, implementation, and support of a world-wide, heavily-used application. 
Scruff has a simple, well-designed user interface; for the most common use, scanning of profiles and communicating quickly, (the ""Woof""), it rates an A. But behind this simple task, there are many segments with usage stats for the members, again straight-forward, easy-to-use. 
Another sign of solid design and fully-staffed support; Scruff rarely crashes and is one of the most reliable apps I have used. 
This 'picky' user gives Scruff, its developers and support staff Five Stars. 
Great men, too! <g>.",,Rockyjoedog,False,2014-06-29 05:44:21,4
1197,5,Not a bad design,"I have to admit I don't pay for the app, and hearing how expensive it is I'm not sure i ever will! However, from a design perspective I have to applaud scruff for making some changes. The simple color change when activity happens (whether you've been viewed, woof'd, etc) is great user experience. The set up of the app itself is pretty intuitive. HOWEVER, I am confused by the little side bar that opens to the left of the app when you launch it, then I can't seem to access it again? What's the point? 
I've got to give props where they're due though, and scruff does seem to care about their users.",,Andyp23,False,2013-07-18 13:11:37,3

An application like this could never replace interpersonal communication but it's a great way to meet guys initially and then meet them out on the town.  From a software development standpoint, the application works flawlessly which gives it a technical edge over similar social applications.

I then got bored with the App and went to go and delete it!... While deleting it, the Scruf app was busy attaching itself to other areas of my phone, without my permission.   When I finally got the app deleted, it took all that information with it!...  Causing me to lose a huge amount of data and contact info from my iPhone 4S!...

I've now spent half the day fixing the damage that was done and also working closely with my cell phone provider to reset my service and recover lost data, because I couldn't even do a hard reset or turn my iPhone off!...

You do a search for a particular city, you only get some of the guys not all of them.  I am trying to find someone in my city that I know for sure is on Scruff but I can never see him???

However it is great to see the hot guys from all over the world. It does eat my battery really quick too. I like that profile pics don't take forever to be approved. Not sure I like having to go online to read messages or do anything with my profile. Just seems like an extra unnecessary step every time. It's free and a way to meet guys and see whos out there. The quality of guys on this site is higher than that which you are most likely to find on Grindr.

When compared to other gay dating apps, Scruff has the best features: the ability to woof, private albums, match, upcoming events, venture, and more. All of these things put the Scruff app far ahead of the others. The free version is okay, but Pro is the way to go.

The app FREEZES regularly, sometimes in the midst of a chat, then it needs to be closed and reopened to continue; the text may or may NOT be saved.
There have been several occasions when the app completely CRASHES, and then I'm looking at a blank screen or the scruff startup logo, depending exactly on what, who knows?
Finally, the badge notifications do not always clear after opening profiles and reading messages. They used to, but not anymore, and the speed with which past messages scroll into Scruff's inaccessible junkyard is a cheap ploy to get more Pro subscribers.",,Robbstn,False,2016-02-29 18:33:43,2

Really expensive considering what you get (the only thing I found helpful was being able to re-visit older chats). Once I upgraded, I stopped getting my notifications regularly, and the swipe feature (where you can swipe through profiles without returning to the main screen) didn't always work smoothly. So my review of 4 stars is for the basic free app, which I enjoy, but SCRUFF is getting really greedy, and I will not be renewing the pay version.",,suspiria4,False,2012-09-12 00:39:48,4

This by itself for me is enough for 5 stars. 

The community is also really great. I know that's going to vary by location, but I've largely only had good experiences, and I've met a lot of hot, fun guys on here. I LOVE that you can sort by community, like jock or student or leather.",,Clothes Whorse,False,2013-06-16 19:06:14,5

I have been on other sites and I think this is the easiest one to find the kind of guy that you want physically.. But such as life not always on an emotional level.. Guys say on here, well it's a sex site... That's just not true.. You make the site out for what you want it to be!!

Now Scruff is better than all of the rest imho, as it was already pre-update. It got rid of the 'maybe' option which was basically useless anyway. Now with Match integrated into the yes/no options for 'Would you like to meet', I'm guessing a lot more ppl would use the WYLTM now that they're tied.

Something I would like to see is a filter option.  I'm sure we would be asked to pay for that too.  It just gets old sorting through age groups.  I also get really annoyed at all the ""partnered"" guys on it.  It would be much better if I could filter out all the ""happily"" partnered guys so I could actually get to converse with someone available.  

A search option would be nice too.  Sadly, right now the only way there is to search is by city.  

I've also had problems with messages not showing up, and taking forever to come through.  Perhaps less time spend on celebrity PR and more time providing a quality product would be good for this app's image.

Only real complaint is not being able to see a guy's full album even after he unlocks it for you. If I still have to pay, what's the point? Only main complaint.

I feel that having to pay $9 a month a total $108 a year is absolutely ridiculous.  I understand that programmers and hosting servers need to be paid but lets not be greedy.

Scruff Support indicated that there was no apparent defect and the Global feed is simply a random selection of enabled users.  Why I would repeatedly appear on the global feed and then all of a sudden stop permanently is somewhat odd.

Sorry guys but no bears or cubs are worth $70 or more year. I think you've let success go to your head???

Your new upgrade lost many of my favorites.  Guess I'll go back to Grindr and the other free apps. Will encourage all Scruff users to do the same!!!!

Best social network app for guys who aren't ""Twinks"".  I hit it off with over 80% of the guys I meet on here. 
99% of the guys are super friendly even if you are not a perfect match.

I'm not even sure what messaging pro gives u other than the ability to look at older messages, and possibly save your pictures inside the app rather than your iPhone.

I think it's funny how most of the 5-star ratings are touting the hot guys but don't address the actual app functions or pricing... Wonder who wrote those?

The free version is SO annoying with the constant reminders and popups that say you have to pay for other features... If you simply scroll to the end of guy lists or message lists in the free version, you _always_ get a popup screaming for you to upgrade, and the popup either has to be closed manually or you have to sit there and wait for it to disappear.

There should be functionality to search for guys within a certain age or ""friendship"" level. And why is it that when you search for guys in an area (nearby/city), they seem to run out. This does not make sense to me, as I am still interested in guys who live further than 2 mi/3 km from me. Still, I love the app.",,JCHudsonSoCal,False,2011-06-17 09:21:23,4

Newest version fixes the few bugs I noticed after the 5.x release (namely the photo recall feature). Might I recommend a brief startup tutorial to show new users (and old) the settings menu?

Sorry scruff, but he'll no! I was willing to pay a one time fee, or even perhaps a low subscription fee. Your monthly fee is way too pricey and the cost if sending pics is a joke now. I'm saddened that I upgraded at all. My Fave app just fell from grace.

And I don't need a global grid throwing the fact that the most woof'd guys are muscular white guys who look like porn stars--I'd already guessed that.

It will suffice until the next better thing surfaces.

Also the server is always down so half the time it doesn't work correctly. The developers might want to have a solid working app. before they charge us for basic features.

I mean really at $9 a month that's just over $100 a year sounds pretty crazy. However as another person put it when you see the creators of this app at all the bear events that must cost money.

The nice guys are still there, I'm sure but finding them has become a confounding, frustrating experience in the new version. You used to easily be able to search in other locations.  No more. It is possible, but not at all intuitive. 

Messages and woofs are partitioned by days and weeks rather than simply displayed in a chronologically ordered grid. 

If you add a filter, one aspect of that filter (e.g., jocks) is displayed adjacent at the top so it reads ""global, nearby, jocks"" so you cannot tell if all or part of your filter is being applied. 

I could go on but to suffice it to say the user experience is now almost unbearable (hehe).

Posting in my feed about this results in the post disappearing.  Replying to this profile with the question results in the message disappearing... 

Image search on google usually finds the profile pictures belong to someone on Instagram or similar.. 

Hornet has gone bad and the way they are doing it is SO OBVIOUS that I question why.  What do they stand to gain, unless the app itself is malicious?

The main problem are the fakes; at best they waste time, but at worst they’ll scam you out of money and potentially your identity. I don’t know if that’s really possible, but I’m sure lots of folks enable location tags on pics and I know one’s email is linked to many apps, including bank apps. Even if that isn’t a problem, Hornet needs to do more. If I, a user, can find where the same photo has been used in three profiles, then surely a tech company can do the same- and I’ve reported quite a few profiles. I have a photo storage app that automatically identifies and collates pictures of people; why does Hornet do that? I’ve been chatted up by no fewer than FIFTEEN fake scammers in one week. Hornet does offer nice advice on instant protestations of love and “too good to be true” issues, and boy do these fakes deliver there. Military, on a mission but coming home soon, maybe a dog or two... strange though, that a guy supposedly born and raised in the states can’t type in English. It’s more than just grammatically poor, it’s absolutely incomprehensible. Hornet needs to find a way to weed these out somehow.

I really think these “LGBTQ+” social apps might be an attempt to make identity politics out to be more popular than it truly is. I used to be more progressive minded, as were a number of my friends, but when you see most real LGBTQ+ people in person are nothing like on these “LGBTQ+” social networks (whom the media doesn’t seem to publicize as much as they do the “elites”), you realize there’s something off about the ebb and flow of these internet social networks. But then this is just for cyberloafer people without real jobs that moreso waste their time online. This is where the propaganda for identity politics flows. In my own experience, I think the discrete political movement to try to propagate our LGBTQ+ community are falling apart, which is good. Their little elite failure groups only have the Internet. All the rest of us are live in person and not buying it. If this wasn’t true, then these app developers would fix the spam problem, but obviously they could care less, and We the LGBTQ+ People are aware of all the fake internet posers.",,Lavender X,False,2019-08-05 21:59:51,1

In all cases it was easy to see the unsophisticated deception as the person on the other end isn’t really talking proper English.  Their texts are often off grammar, miss basic Americanisms that anyone would easily type.

This app reminds me of if Instagram and Grindr had a baby and named it hornet. It combines location based profiles with versions filters similar to grindr but also has the ability to search usernames, hashtags, as well as create posts and follow users. 

I also love that hornet is constantly working to create a great community where users get rewarded a hornet badge when they are authentic. This is a great concept to help removing bots and and bad people.

201,3,I Had Mixed Feelings,"I came onto Hornet to search for a place where I can meet gay guys like me. I’m not one to filter, but I think it would have been nice to have a platform where gay men could just connect and converse. It might be because I didn’t stay too long but first impressions are very important.

A lot of guys that contacted me were just looking for hookups, maybe you can add a filter that differentiates people looking for pleasure and people looking for community. For first timers in a social media platform based on sexuality, I expected to get hookup requests and all of that, but I was hoping I could feel welcome.

Again I met someone, so not all was lost. He lives across the world from me but it’s cool to have a connection out of America and I don’t mind a long distance friendship. It’s a fact that there is a mix of guys who want to find friends and people to learn from and relate to and guys who just want a good night.

It’d be helpful to separate these two collective intentions to give users a better experience.

Maybe there was a filter, maybe not, it could’ve came with premium even I won’t say I know for sure if you guys have a solution that some users might not acknowledge in the first place. 

Overall if you are gonna have a social platform be ready for anything, updates and feedback is important. Instead of being similar to other sites that focus on dating, try to really go for a difference and expand on quality of variety a little more than what I’ve already seen.

Help users navigate directly to a community of their interests instead of having a platform where  a variety of guys can get mixed easily. 

Again you could be working on this; I love the concept and potential this app has so keep up the good work, because in the end even though I don’t use this app anymore, I found someone I genuinely connected with.

I also really love the news and articles and giving a writing platform for the guys, that’s pretty dooe!",,Chris (Tallbean),False,2018-11-28 06:38:05,4

Worry no longer!! Hornet is your horny six pack paradise. My favorite difference between Hornet and the impotent Grindr is that you can actually put more photos on your profile, WITHOUT annoying ads to buy their defunct product that they don't even check their reviews for.

Albeit, there's still annoying marketing, but at least no more bots!! Thank god!! Although don't come on here expecting lifelong love and happiness.

You have a team that cares obviously, but PLEASE COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW AND UNIQUE. Every gay chat app is the same. Implement video chat features or something else different. UNIQUE! Give us a reason to leave Grindr. I can assure you that you are not going to drive in an abundance of us by putting ads all over the place and limiting features in an aggravating way. I use Grindr because I easily get laid with it and occasional go some dates. It has plentiful men. It's simple. To beat it you are going to have to do something different and create features we haven't seen yet. Please do so!! I would love to leave buggy Grindr to use Hornet, but at the moment there is no point.

I feel good that your company feels the urge to include those of us that are unfortunate enough to have contracted but honestly no test result is truly a negative test result unless you are abstinent... Which I am pretty sure is less than 5% of the people using this app. That being said, I really find it a bit ridiculous that people put their last test date like it's supposed to bring some form of comfort instead of the 'potentially awkward' moment of the question and answer part of so many people's sex lives.

I wish distances were shown in the Nearby and thumbnail view (as they are on Jack’d). Hornet allows more photos (both public and private) than Jack’d. Hornet allows FAR LESS space in one’s Profile for personal interests and activities than Jack’d. And Hornet offers far fewer filtering fields (only age and nationality/race). I was getting double-notifications until I added a second device. Hmmm. There are not as many people nearby using Hornet as Jack’s in my area (West LA/UCLA), the latter being far more popular here.

230,3,"Not horrible, but not great","I thought I would update my review now that the app has been updated. Unfortunately, even on an iPhone 5, it's slow to refresh the grid or changes to a profile. This is on Wi-Fi and on LTE, so it's clearly not my phone or the network I am on.  Sometimes you still get a random error when making changes to your profile after waiting minutes for it to update.

The ""chats"" that come from Hornet are a little much. I don't care about which celebrity du jour has ""come out"", reminders to update my profile, and all the other filler. 

What I care about is an app that works near-flawlessly, has an intuitive interface, has a wide userbase, doesn't take you to the financial cleaners for basic features, or drains my battery like a vampire at a blood bank.

Hornet mostly succeeds in these areas except for the slowness and bugginess I mentioned, but also userbase which is subjective. As with any app, the people will be the same old group you see on other apps if you live outside a major metro area.

""Premium"" prices seem to be more in-line with Jack'd which is a good thing. However, none of these apps really ""have it down"" to the point it's worth a subscription.

To what extent does each app offer their features and perks for free before you hit that brick wall where you will need to buy a premium status if you want the full experience.

 After a few days, I realized that many of the profiles to which I sent messages, and was interested, are not online.   I could wait and wait, but they don't come online.  
Did you notice that unlike other similar apps, this one doesn't tell you when someone was last online or active??  Go figure...
I looked at other profiles across the grid to realize that many don't seem active and there's nothing to make me think hopefully that they are present or will be anytime soon!   The circumstance doesn't change much.   There's an illusion, a few changes, changes of profiles, but too many offline.
Unlike some other apps, it's not a free service to review who checked you out and so on.   So, its like you're just swimming about looking for something, then to realize you're in a big ocean full of dead bodies that are just floating about.   From a distance, it looks like a live, active beach; but, after walking about the coast and then taking a swim, you get suspicious in a bad way...

It's still better than Grindr by a mile. 

HOWEVER, now navigating profiles and moving back and forth between chats is even worse than before. 

Also, a glitch that has now stung me twice: when I try to delete a chat, the app freezes briefly and you end up tapping ""delete"" twice because you think it didn't read the touch, and then it deletes two conversations, including the one with the cutie you didn't WANT to delete. 

~~~~~~

Very good app with ability to make decently detailed profile with public and private pics, and a shareable link to our profile, and the ability to share pics within a chat!

264,5,Definitely the best one!,I think this app is definitely the best one between homo social networks! Because most of the important features are free. You can check as much as profiles you want.

265,1,Hornet STINGS,"It's amazing, I've never come across a gay networking app with SO MANY NIGERIAN FRAUDS, guys phishing and pre-programmed bots that lead you to sex sites!  Seriously, EVERY time I open this app there is at least one phony guy from Nigeria or a ""stranded US Military soldier"" asking for money. You can always tell by their grammar, which is atrocious and they either have a very minimal profile or none at all. 

I was a member several years ago but now it's just a bunch of dudes phishing for your ISP info, 95% of my messages get trashed before they're even opened. There are probably more sincere contacts in my ""junk mail file!""
I think all the ""hornets"" have flown to other ""hives!"" Sad to say I think this app's ""shelf-life"" has expired and perhaps only 1 in 20 profiles on ""Hornet"" are real now. 

I'll be buzzin' off to another site pronto. Sorry Hornet, you lost your ""sting""!  No, you cannot give negative stars though I'd give ""Hornet"" about 5-neg stars if it were possible. It's really too bad.",,Great Horned Toad,False,2017-05-21 20:53:41,1

It's always giving error messages that never get fixed. Perpetual server issues. Slow interface. Sends messages 10x, then not at all. Crashes regularly.

This tells me this app either has: a major security flaw (scary!) that lets them do this so fast, or they need to delete the ability to look all over the world at guys as part of the app.  Or even more likely the app was developed by the scammers themselves.

1574,5,Everything Grindr Wishes It Were and More,"Finally, a viable and superior alternative to Grindr, Scruff, Distinct and the others that is comprehensive, intuitive, easy to navigate, and useful. This team definitely did their homework AND development; and so far they have been very responsive to feedback.

I confess I was at first confused and troubled by the app name; I don't know anyone who ascribes positive connotations to a flying, stinging insect. But no matter. At first glance, there is an immediate sense that this is an app that can replace its predecessors on anyone's devices.

Its sleek design provides an intuitive interface that allows ready access to account features, new users, nearby contacts, a complete chat history, and even exploring other regions of a city and the world.

The profile setup is a huge improvement over Grindr's in that it allows each user to upload up to four public photos and four private ones, the latter of which may remain locked until granting permission for selected other users to see them. The same rules of no nudity apply here, ensuring that those who are looking for more than ""networking"" can search nearby contacts without having their feed cluttered with excessive and unnecessary lasciviousness. 

One of the most appealing innovations of the photo feed is that when tapping on a profile photo to declutter the screen and see it in full view, there still remains a small icon on the top left indicating which photo of the series being viewed. This is no small consideration. The icon is discreet enough to permit full viewing of a user's photos but is prominent enough to discourage would-be photo thieves from screen-capturing the pics and using them as their own.

The profile interface allows the passive-aggressive among us to send a heart to someone of interest -- similar to the ""Woof"" feature on Scruff -- but a particularly unique new feature can be found with ""notes,"" whereby a user can write and keep private up to 128 characters about the user he is viewing and/or chatting with.

There is, of course, a ""favorite"" feature here, but the Hornet team takes it to another level of social networking: users may choose to mail a specific profile to a friend, text it to a friend, and/or forward it to someone else already marked as a favorite. And this is the first app of its kind that permits users to see people who favorited their profile.

There are other features here that you'd expect from a social networking app: seeing new users and ""who checked you out,"" searching nearby, and the ability to send other pics and one's location to another user in a chat -- but this app has two very significant improvements that I think make it really stand out. 

By the tapping of a button on the home screen, a user can surf the app in ""invisible"" mode -- perfect for maintaining discretion. And the best improvement, in my view, is the ability to explore other cities, areas, regions, and even countries. Scruff had it first, but Hornet -- like so many other features -- takes it to an entirely different level with a movable map that one can adjust to explore specific areas of a town with absolute ease.

All in all, everyone who has complained for over three years about Grindr and the limitations of its successors have their Holy Grail. Provided the development team continues to be as adaptive, innovative, and responsive as they have so far shown themselves to be, this app has a long future and a good chance at domination of a lucrative market share.",,ReasonWinsOut,False,2013-05-02 20:15:48,5

1879,2,Deleting,"I've been a hornet premium member for a number of years. The app used to be great and I do think they are trying.  Sadly the most recent versions are not nearly as good as former versions.  

The final deal breaker for me was that Hornet started spamming me with sales messages about wine and even worse was the political message they felt necessary to send me unsolicited.  

Business who email/message their customers with any political message are ridiculously foolish because inevitably they alienate about half their customers.  To make matters worse, when I reached out to support the gentlemen who responded told me they stand by the nonsensical statement!  While he was professional and courteous, I was even more surprised that there was no acknowledgement that mixing politics with business is a bad idea.  

Even worse, and more comical, is the Hornet staff then asked me to rate and review the app ""because they are suffering badly from a case of the ""1 Star-Trashers"" and they desperately need some 5 Star Reviews"" 

Well Hornet staff, if you'd actually take the time to look in the mirror you might not need to beg for good reviews. If you took a step outside the box and had some people with real world business and customer service experience, they would have told you in no uncertain terms that spamming your customers with political messages is a shockingly bad idea.  In the long, sad, history of bad ideas, this ranks among the worst.  

I will be sad to delete this app. It works fairly well even though not as well as it used to.  The premium version is also fairly priced although there is no way to opt out of specific messages from the Hornet team.  They provide some good info on sexual health and other topics but if you want to get that you are forced to revive political statements, sales pitches for wine, and whatever other nonsense they are going to try and shove down your throat.",,Michaeld8,False,2017-02-10 12:06:14,2
