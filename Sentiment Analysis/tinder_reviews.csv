2022-05-28 15:04:00,"I used to unironically like Tinder, even at its base form I’ve gotten matches that ended up leading to great relationships. Unfortunately, as time has passed the company has made taken away features and slowly asked for more money to unlock them; specifically with super likes. 
     I’ve travelled alot and used tinder gold each time I travelled to find friends in new countries. Having five super likes a day helped me stand out from the crowd and led to fairly consistent matches. Even on a base account having access to the occasional super like was a huge help. 
     Nowadays on a base tinder account you don’t have any super likes which is genuinely a huge detriment, and on tinder gold you get five a week. A massive decrease of 35 a week to 5. But the price remained the same???
     A super like was a fantastic way to differentiate yourself in an environment where first impressions are everything. And for some guys and gals who are great people but not super models it can help hedge your bets to match with people you have a genuine interest with. I think taking that tool to consistently show interest in people you genuinely like was a bad decision for the company.

And when this happens, there’s no appeal process and they don’t give you ANY reason as to why it happened. The reason why I’m guessing I got banned was because I accidentally glitched out of the photo verification process and they just shut my account down. It seems I’m not the only one, too. Their support is also atrocious. Good luck actually talking to a human being. I tried submitting a request on their website, and got an automated response basically saying tough luck. They put a phone number on their website, but the line goes dead when you try to call. You can go on their support site on Twitter and you’ll see just how terrible they are. They honestly don’t care about you, even if you pay them $89 + a year for their useless premium subscriptions. What’s also troubling is that people who ACTUALLY DESERVE to be banned are running rampant on that app! There’s bots, people being sexually harassed (pictures of that on twitter, and they had a generic “I’m sorry” response to it), and constant spam accounts. Even worse, I saw that trans people are being banned also for no reason!

About 2 weeks ago I redownloaded the app to give it another shot. However, I was randomly banned without any explanation as to why. I believe I was banned because so many guys I had matched with made sexual advances towards me and I denied them. So they most likely reported my account. And although I have only been back on the app for 2 weeks, despite my profile saying I’m looking for a relationship so many guys asked for sexual favors or wanted to hookup. Making vulgar and crass remarks unprompted often right off the bat. Which I should not be reported for.

I've never harassed anyone or pursued anyone beyond a clear ignoring of a message or unmatch. Not was my profile spam or fake in any way. I was instructed by the generic automated email when I reached out and all I was told is that I ""violated the user agreement or terms of use"" or something along those lines.

Furthermore, I’ve both the free version of tinder, and I’ve used tinder gold, and I’ve found that disgustingly, you find more minorities and people people with a larger body size tend to appear significantly more frequently on the free tinder algorithm.

Moderation is automated, with profiles being banned automatically after receiving *any* three reports, regardless of their validity or content. This is a common way to cut costs that is known to be easily exploitable by users. Men and women maliciously false report each other for rejection or not replying fast enough, leading to automated bans that cannot be contested. You can find videos of so-called “pickup artists” getting women banned after exchanging phone numbers so there will be less competition for her attention. I personally was banned after not replying to women for two weeks; several of them falsely reported me out of revenge and tinder support refuses to review the situation.  

Tinder’s male-to-female ratio is notoriously poor, in some regions being as bad as 9-to-1 according to one study. This leads to unhappiness for everyone, as women are spammed and men are ignored. To give the impression of there being more women, tinder ignores your search preferences and shows you women far outside of your age and geographic ranges. I do not want to date 18 year olds, they cannot hold a conversation. If you want to see women no less than X years old, you must set your minimum age to X+3 in my experience.

Used to tinder for three years and I have no clue why my account was banned so I am probably going to do the same thing again somewhere else. You can’t make another profile because it all connects through Facebook. I now realize that I also had the bug where you don’t see your matches in your match list they keep disappearing and coming back. My conversations were also disappearing and coming back it would be days and weeks in between. I will never use dating apps again I’m just going to use Facebook dating if anything and that’s it this app has ruined all dating apps for me that’s how bad this app is.

What used to be a fun and reliable way to meet girls of all types with different interests became an unfortunate hub for unsuspecting males being cancelled without warning, without notice. Sadly, Tinder is the biggest and the most well known place for dating of all types but they are the opposite of a leader in society, by becoming selective in who gets to engage and enjoy dating life, which has become increasingly reliant on just one single outlet, which is mainly online, for some people, it is more than others, and dating is more online based in 2020 than ever before. In the past, we relied on a multitude of destinstions both physical and digitial in order to date and meet mates. How unfair is it that this seems like THE public square, through mostly no fault of our own, the ONLY public square for so many, yet some get banned for no good reason and don't get to date. How lacking in honor and respect for mankind.

It makes trying to have a continuous conversation very hard. On top of that, a recent update with the option to allow video calls has made conversation hard. After a couple back and forth messages, a pop up will appear at the bottom of the screen, covering about 1/3 of the screen. It asks if you are fine with video calls with that specific person. I like that it seeks consent. The only way to get rid of the giant pop up is agreeing or disagreeing. When you open the keyboard with the pop up still there, it just moves up, covering your conversation. I used to like the app. But in the past year or so, it has gone downhill.

Privacy was a huge issue in one of the insistences (Do Not add where you go to school!!!).

Thankfully my school did and I’m assuming I was not found guilty of the accusations as I didn’t get expelled. 

Furthermore, my partner and I wanted to find a third consistent partner as that is the lifestyle we wish to live and have the right to do so. I’m assuming that tinder frowned upon this as both of our accounts were banned without the possibility of recreating an account to simply find friends or a connection individually. It would have been great to get a warning before being banned. We weren’t hurting anyone on the app, many people were willing to connect with us and had no issues.

However, with this app being infamous for mainly hookups or casual encounters, the pickings for someone more substantial (platonic or romantic) is slim to say the least. As well, like in other apps, the amount of empty profiles or spam accounts overwhelms the amount of real people. I do wish that there was a sort of requirement of word count in each profile so that if someone IS serious about matching, they have a (somewhat) cohesive bio to show this. While I’ll always enjoy the interface and the simplicity of Tinder and don’t personally see myself off the app anytime soon (especially given the time I’m writing this) I do wish there were a more comprehensive way to weed out the casual from serious or the hookups from genuine friendships WITHOUT having to download yet another app.",3,False,MsGenki,Could always be better,

I’ve swiped for hours and barley see it go down, and barley get any more matches, yet apparently there are 20 people who've liked me and are stuck ion my waiting list, essentially. So basically forcing me to either pay another $20 to see my likes and matches, or for an extra $30, ensure that my likes get to the front of the line.

First of all, cell phones don’t have static because they’re not analog TVs, so the glitching effect makes no sense. All the ambulances you see are from the 1970s because that’s all they had access to I guess. The sets are tiny and empty, I guess because the portrait aspect ratio doesn’t allow you to see much of the environment, so maybe that’s actually good filmmaking then. Obviously the acting is terrible and they try way to hard to make people sound “hip” and cool. Maybe they based the dialog on all y’all’s chat logs and some of you really talk like that.

What should be a great way to get someone you’re really interested in to know, they’ve been branded as “creepy” or “thirsty”. And intros. The fundamental basics of conversation are greetings, but those aren’t welcome here. People demand something mind blowing right off the bat, and they’re still unlikely to respond. And finally, maybe the worst thing is, Tinder will actively select who’s most attractive and show them first. If you’re anything less than gorgeous, you won’t be seen.

You would assume tinder would do something to fix it or even address some people, but they don't, and that is the most annoying thing.

I’m not even going to discuss the ban issue because there is more than enough reviews on that so let’s discuss the shadowban. If you’ve ever wondered why you used to get a lot of likes but no longer receive any ? Shadowban! If you ever wondered why you send a lot of messages but never get any replies? Shadowban! Basically anything you do will get you shadowbanned or actually banned but the craziest part is they will never give you a warning or inform you and they will continue to give you a couple likes every blue moon so you will continue to pay for boost/tinder gold… At this point they are running a successful multi million dollar scam empire that will end with them getting sued and I am seriously considering taking legal action,1,False,James Ramirez IV,The Biggest Scam,

Some are blatantly fake with pics of porn stars and bios with misspelled words and bot created Snapchat names. Some even go as far as just putting a cashapp in the bio.

The main issue with the app is that there are too many annoying and repetitive bugs that completely destroy the user experience. 

First off, why even have an option to “only show people in this range” if every other profile you show is 2000+ miles away from the range I set? I mean, I get it. The app runs out of users to show you after a while and is forced to recommend profiles outside the range. But then why not just say that the app has run out of profiles and leave it at that? My guess is that the devs are trying way too hard to waste people’s time and keep them on the app as long as possible.

Second, literally every other swipe I get a notification that says “Super like to increase your odds by 5x.” Now, I personally wouldn’t care about the constant notification. But it’s literally right above the profiles distance for you. Which is the number. one. consideration. when deciding on whether to swipe right or not. Again, this goes back to my initial theory that the devs are looking for ways to keep users on the app.

It has serious implications on society when one company owns all the major dating platforms that, unfortunately, are the main way an entire generation meets their romantic partners.

Ever since I got out of my last relationship, I’ve been blown away by how terrible Tinder is. I’ve tried it all: free, plus, gold, and now platinum. None of it does anything.

I’m fully convinced that the people I’d actually like to talk to just don’t see my profile at all.

I don’t know. Maybe too many people are using this now. But it’s clear that Tinder’s new ownership has prioritized selling literally useless packages to make a quick buck. In 2017, I could get a dozen matches a day for free in a small town. In a city 5X that size, I’m lucky if I get a dozen a month while paying for the ridiculously priced platinum package.

MAYBE 1 out of 500 is a possible match, if that. Oh, you thought your profile got priority treatment when you paid for “Platinum”? Sorry, guess again; that costs extra. I guess it’s fake platinum.

EVERYTHING the Match Group touches has zero desire to actually help you match and every desire to make money off of your loneliness. EVERYTHING.

2022-01-25 22:02:22,After reading some reviews I saw that many people had the same issue I experienced with getting ghost banned. The user agreement is fairly straightforward (basically don’t be rude or use inappropriate language) but even when using the app and following the rules all it takes is someone to report your account to get your account banned. Tinder doesn’t have a review system in place they just automatically block accounts with no appeal option. With the being said when you spend money on tinder it’s very irritating to get ghost banned and loose your matches/ money. I found tinder to be a fun app at first but it definitely makes you spend money to get any results. I used to have a tinder 6 years ago it was no where near as expensive as it is now. I would honestly recommend hinge over tinder because they have a great customer support system that will help you out if you have these types of account troubles.,1,False,Jay1994444,"No customer support, app will ghost ban you",

2022-12-28 14:40:57,"I went from 6 likes a year to a superuser so i think i can fairly review Tinder. 
Tinder has had a cultural impact that is unignorable. 
We use it for friends, hookups, and looking for long term dating partners. 
But it has gamified conversations and dating to a level never before seen. Those who can manipulate and adapt to the visual storytelling of the profile get hundreds if not thousands of matches, and those who can also put cute and cheeky energy into the first message and throughout the conversation can have as many partners as they want.
And therein lies the problem.
You can always have more. There is no limit to the number of men or women you can have if you know how to attract them. So when a relationship has a problem, you can just end it and move onto the next one.
This is very damaging for those who are looking to settle down, because they struggle keeping a partner who has multiple other girls/guys lined up.
Or they have to settle for someone who seems unattractive compared to all the other guys/girls theyve matched with before.
We get our ego stroked here. Even if the other person just wants us for a hookup, or imagines us as a good rebound from their last relationship, we feel a validation on the match that is a reward in itself.

Guys - Are you looking to talk to bots or subscribe to women’s onlyfans and premium snapchats? Do you love being manipulated and used for your money? If you’ve answered yes, then you’ve come to the right place. 

Women - Are you tired of paying for groceries? Swipe right on a solid 4 and never pay for your own dinner for the rest of your life. 

Looking for actual love? Thinking you swiped right on your soulmate? Think again - enjoy the side effects of tinder: crying alone at night in your bedroom while questioning your self worth, excessive drinking, checking snap scores like a paranoid psycho, staring at your phone all day praying for a text that never comes, over thinking every little thing and driving yourself insane.

For me, this app made it difficult to have and to keep a relationship as I would think of the girls that I could be with via Tinder. Psychologically speaking, there are three things that make you stay in a relationship:
1. Investment into that relationship
2. *Availability of other people*
3. Time in that relationship
Availability is, typically, the most difficult. However, dating apps (and hookup apps, like Tinder) make you feel as though there is a million different people out there, all at your fingertips. They might be, or they might not. It can mess with your head though.

From regularly reminding you to use your super likes (free users only get one per day) to withholding matches (they will tell you “match with ____ when you buy tinder gold” but will not display that profile in the stack) it creates a poor user experience. 

I could complain about bots, prostitutes, ads, or scams but that’s all common knowledge with this app. 

They will regularly insert advertisements into you matches without prior warning. I have even gotten “new match” notifications only to find that my “new match” is an ad for something I do not care about in the slightest.

The final issue with this app isn’t even with the app itself. The culture it has allowed to exist in the app is one of “gaining a small ego boost” from a match rather than actually meeting up.

When I tried to delete it I got a message that said I could not delete my profile.  After trying for days I contacted tinder and asked for them to delete my profile and try again.  Days later they answered and said they deleted my profile but I was banned because I violated the terms of service. I asked how did I do that when there was never anyone to match with.  They said it was their discretion and there was nothing I could do.  I threw a few F bombs and told them they are now banned too!!,1,False,719jj,Horrible experience,

Swipe limit:
The daily swipe limit was recently massively reduced, making the app borderline unusable without paying for a subscription.

You missed a match:
If I didn’t swipe right on a user, it obviously wasn’t a match. This is a stupid and irritating notification.

Popular user:
This notification pops up on half of the profiles you swipe, prompting you to use a super like to get noticed by someone tinder deems out of your league. It is annoying, and feels like a slap in the face every time it pops up.

Distance feature doesn’t work:
There is a distance slider to supposedly adjust the geographical zone of profiles you are shown. In addition, there is a switch marked “show only people in this range.” With this switch turned on and my range set to 25 miles, more than half of the profiles I see are still thousands of miles away. I live in Los Angeles and know there is no shortage of people nearby. What is the point of having this feature if it does absolutely nothing?

Other bugs:
For an app as popular as Tinder, there is no excuse for the plethora of bugs that plague the app.

Verifying your account and making sure you are who your pictures are is a great way of making sure that the person who is posting photos is who they say they are. 

I believe that tinder, and app developers of tinder should only allow accounts that are verified to be on tinder. It would get rid of the accounts that are “spam” and would create a safer environment for people to meet others. 

I’m not sure how the whole verification process works. I know that you take two pictures in certain poses and then I guess a team of people decided if those pictures you take match the certain poses. I think the team that verifies those pictures should also go into the account and make sure the ones they post are the same ones they took to get verified! And or have a mode where you only see verified accounts!

Tinder should be giving me a few kickbacks at this point for finding fakes.  Actually…that would be fun…just do not want to do it for nothing.  (Like each fake you find and confirmed you get a point…after 10 points you get a fee month of gold…pretty quick the fakes would get cleaned out)

Gonna drop Tinder (not pay anymore)…if I keep getting fakes…maybe they need to add some better account verification???

Gave three stars as I think the app has promise.  Just needs a bit more polish on getting the fakes away.  

Also get some fakes on another dating app (think large social media giant)…so it’s not unique to Tinder…but at least the other one is free!!!

But it has been over run with bots since day one and nothing has been done about them. I’m convinced Tinder doesn’t care about them bc it makes their app appear more populated and causes people to interact with the app more often. 

It doesn’t seem out of the question for Tinder to crack down on the bots since other dating apps aren’t as infested. 

The other issue is the app sends you notifications that you can’t turn off without completely disabling notifications from settings. I have all notifications turned off except messages and I still get 3 a day spamming me to swipe. It’s very annoying since the only reason I get the notification is bc tinder is trying to bump interaction with the app and there is no way to turn these notifications off. 

I do not need to be reminded to start swiping 3 times a day. This shouldn’t even be a notification.

2020-09-07 23:28:41,"I use tinder as much as any normal single human being and I woke up one day attempting to talk to someone I had met the night prior, but I opened the app and I was banned. No reason! I’ve gone through the community guidelines and nothing I’ve done has ever come close to violating the terms of services. So thanks I guess? I’ve tried trying to communicate with anyone on their support team and turns out there is none. There isn’t a way to get your Account reviewed to be unbanned or talk to anyone about being banned or any support team at all for that matter. Not very cash money.",1,False,Unmarkedking,I got banned for no reason!?,
2020-09-03 22:46:54,"After getting banned for no reason, and with no explanation I began to receive dozens of messages from other people with similar experiences. Your social media is also flooded with testimonies from hundreds of users that have been banned after doing nothing wrong. Ironically, Tinder is forcing hundreds (if not thousands) of banned users to move their business and money to other apps! It’s also hysterical how many fake accounts are made on Tinder every day to promote scams, but they’re not banned, and we’re not allowed to recover or create a new account! Do Not Use Tinder!",1,False,STEVENNREED,Banning users for NO reason,
2020-08-30 15:12:51,"Paid for 6 months of premium service, got my profile verified with a blue check mark and barely a whole month into being a user my profile was banned with no explanation other than a generalized statement that said I violated their terms of service. I read through the terms of service and community guidelines multiple times and could not find a single policy that I violated. Sent an email to customer support for an explanation but heard nothing back. That’s a lot of money to just give up.

Update : Customer service responded with yet another generic response and no specific violation.",1,False,R0X45,Banned for no logical reason,
