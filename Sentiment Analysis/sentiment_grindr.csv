0,5,Does job but here’s how it can be better,"The app gets the job done, although there are some modifications to make it better. Providing users more filter controls to find their person of interest would be more helpful. Giving users the accessibility to find their ideal partner based on position, ethnicity, distance, height and weight helps users devote more time to interacting with their ideal person, as opposed to blocking users for being outside these margins. Also, showing users that are local as opposed to longer distance can draw more users to engage with the app and fulfill the pursuit of finding their person of interest. Alas, the filter setting should converge with other corresponding users. For instance, if a user is looking for someone within a set age range, then anyone outside of that age range should not be able to see that user from their account, unless they are within the age range. If these modifications were made on the non-premium version of Grindr, more users (especially of the younger audience) would be inclined to used Grindr.","{'id': 22640851, 'body': ""Hi there, \n\nThank you very much for the thoughtful review!

1,1,Horrible,"I have been using this app for several years for what this app is used for. Then on the day I decide to purchase a one month membership to get the Xtra features I was banned without notice. I thought it to be a technical glitch so I reached out to the support for them and asked for reasons on the ban  and they said all I have todo is appeal the ban. I went a week without word back, and reached out again and again. Then I received a email back that only said that I now have a lifetime ban and that I’m screwed because I purchased it, but better cancel my subscription or they will keep billing me. The only thing they said why I was banned was because of community guidelines. I asked for clarification on what I violated because I had no nudity, no foul language, no in appropriate speech, and as a person I don’t talk bad about other people. 
This is a horrible app, if you are doing what you are supposed to be doing. And they are no help in trying to rectify the situation. The language that they used in there correspondence with me makes me feel like I am a bad person, and being punished for something that never happened. I have been warned about random people getting banned for no reason then get excommunicated for absolutely no reason. Shame on the company Grindr, Inc. same on what you do to loyal customers and I hope this prevents you from marking any money off of your next victim.

2,1,Safety is not a commodity,"I’ve downloaded and deleted this app several times over the years, my only issue: the safety. Users must PAY for SAFETY FEATURES. I understand the need to monetize, but there are other ways - host member only community events. Prioritize member profiles in the grid. Something, anything, but safety. Why can I not delete an address I accidentally sent? What if that person actually comes to my house or stalks me? It happened. Why do men who have had accounts deleted or removed for harassment have so much access to the app, the ability to create seemingly unlimited accounts? Grindr is transparent about their non liability in safety policies but I expect more for my community. Safety cannot be guaranteed, that is a given in any space online or physical. But why is dangerous behavior permitted? Why must I, a struggling college student, pay $20/month for access to basic safety features I can find in any other social media platform? Especially in the current climate of violence towards LGBTQ people, to trans people facing disproportionate amounts of violence. I come back to the app occasionally because I like to emphasize my effort to be a part of the community, connect with people I feel seen by and safe with in a world I already see as so dangerous to people like me. I want the community. But I’m disappointed time and time again to see Grindr devalue their users, violate and capitalize our right to safety.",,disappointed community member,False,2022-10-22 17:59:21,1
3,1,Will ban your account and ability to create any other accounts,"I’ve given this my utmost effort, and really did not want to give a bad review. The Grindr support team is not very helpful, and has not responded to me in almost a month after a 4-month battle to try and get my accounts back or restore my ability to create a new account and use the app. I was banned in March of 2022 and instantly reached out to support with an appeal, with my main profile being unbanned. However, was told that I needed to submit an appeal to all of the accounts I had, which was one other account through my Apple ID. After submitting a second appeal for my Apple ID account I was required to know the date of creating my account, which was unknown to me since I had not used it in a long time. I was told that there was nothing they could do since I did not know when I made the account and have since not received an email back from my email sent on June 10th, 2022. It is July 4th. This all sprung from a claim that I was underage even though I had sent pictures of my drivers license to prove it, which apparently isn’t enough. I’m still unable to use the app whatsoever or create a new account without an instant ban. I’m not the only person with this issue, and others have had this issue even after purchasing a subscription and completely losing the money. Beware.","{'id': 30796172, 'body': ""Hi there,\n\nWe must protect our users' security even when it's inconvenient. We cannot allow access to an account someone cannot prove is theirs.

4,1,My account got banned for no reason and Grindr support is nonexistent,"I went to a guys place 15 miles away and when I got there he had told me to “kms”, then proceeded to block me. I was obviously shocked so I decided to warn other by putting his user in my about me and warning others about him. The next day I had found out I had been blocked, I was confused and looked it up. There’s apparently no other way to get your account back unless you file an appeal, so I did. The Grindr support that reviewed my case didn’t care and told me the decision was final. So I just gave up on that account and tried to create a new account but as soon as I was down creating the account, it would say the account was banned. I’ve tried deleting the app, restarting my phone, trying different ways to create a new account, you name it I’ve tried it. All to no avail. I proceeded to reach out to Grindr support team once again but they again told me they couldn’t do anything and pretty much dismissed my problem. I had been getting tired of the app for a while but that just did it for me. What got me was how unhelpful the “support” team was, and how they literally didn’t care about what I had to say or anything. This was two weeks ago and I have not found a solution to my problem and a member of the support team even told me they will not respond to any of my further emails.","{'id': 28479323, 'body': ""Hi there,\n\nI'm sorry to read about your experience.

5,1,"Please fix your quality control, Grindr devs","The following is not a helpdesk/end-user problem; it is a long-running QC issue that should not have the buck passed on to us consumers to solve. Pros: The only thing this app has going for it in terms of positive user experience is that there are so many people using it. 1 star for the ubiquity. Cons: Unfortunately, for me, with my iPhone 12, my phone constantly freezes any time I download and use this app. Further, my phone gets extremely hot to the touch, and my battery drains so drastically that I have to charge it any time I’m using this app. These behaviors occur only when I have Grindr running. If I kill the app, my phone is fine. When I delete the app, my phone is fine. I’ve yet to do an iOS restore as a last-stitch effort, but in this nearly Web 3 era and decades of smart phones, how can this one app crash my phone so badly? I’ll tell you: sometimes I can’t even kill the app for minutes; the entire phone becomes unresponsive. Have you read their version update logs? It’s a generic description each time. What are the developers actually fixing with the plethora of versions being released? How about focusing on RAM and CPU usage? Very limited recommendation and I would never pay for it at this point.

6,1,All the reviews are fake!,"Edit!!!!! I have been reporting fake accounts, I talked to one account and they seemed fake but sent a video showing they was “real”. They send their location and their address. and right when I show up I knock and it was an old couple who said no one young lived there and when I got back on the app it was a fake account asking for a steam pay account. This account stayed up for 6 days before being taken down!!! Someone needs to be taking the owners of grindr to court for this stuff!!
This app is FULL of fake accounts, when they are reported NOTHING happens to them! At all. They upload blurry photos they got off google and then they will tag a location asking for gift cards or credit card info, others will say “tired of this app go here and enjoy” and there’s about 2 of those messages a day. So aside from the HORRIBLE amount of spam and scammers they OVERRRRR charge for a monthly membership..I’m sorry...$20 a month to see who’s 10+ miles away...? Or $20 a month to see who is a top or bottom..like really...? You can buy a Netflix membership for cheaper then they charge just for a few things. (100% not worth that price.)

7,1,Not inclusive of trans women,"For a dating app that states they cater to the LGBTQ community, they don’t really care for transgender women. I used Grindr a lot prior to my transition and never had an issue. Fast forward 5 years later and now a post-op trans woman I decided to try it out again and my account was banned after a few weeks on the app. When I reached out to appeal my ban, Nathan from “Grindr Support” stated that the decision was final, there’s nothing that can be done, and that they would not be responding to any further inquiries about my account. Even though I express to them that I didn’t care to know “who” reported me, I more so wanted to know the reason of my ban for example what exact term or condition did I “violate” to get banned? Being that I didn’t lie about who I was, I never offended/disrespected anyone, nor used fake info, my profile was the cleanest profile on that app. There are some that have their bare bottoms as their profile pics, sending endless inappropriate pictures/messages, and even some literally offering money for sexual favors…..yet, I was the one that got banned. It felt like they didn’t even bother to look into it or actually try to help. At this point I’m getting BIG transphobic vibes.

Paid subscriber for years. They just have gotten too expensive. Their pic moderation seems extremely biased and is not consistent. If you aren’t a twink or muscle guy any pic seems to get moderated. I have screen shot over 280 pics where the pic wasn’t moderated and mine was. Either it’s racial or body specific. I talking to an attorney to see what type of class action lawsuit can be filed for it to either have them consistently moderate or shut the site down.

A photo that appears to be similar, but is just over the line is not. To the untrained eye, this can appear as bias, but our moderators are highly skilled and know our guidelines.

9,4,It’s really not too bad,"I don’t think Grindr deserves ALL the hate it gets. Sure, there are a ton of bots and scams, but if your IQ is higher than room temperature, they’re so easy to spot. The ads definitely get annoying so I wish they had a bottom (lol) tier price to strictly remove ads for us poverty gays. I’d pay $5 a month for that alone. Really for an app like this, you get what you put into it. If your profile is trashy, don’t complain if your DMs are full of trash. I’ve had a lot of success using the app and made some genuine connections with some awesome guys!

All that being said, guys claiming to be 18, 19, 20 scare me sometimes since there is NO age verification on the app. I have started to avoid this age group. This is dangerous for both underage young men who are no doubt using the app and for everyone else using the app. All it takes is proof of picture ID to end this phenomenon which countless other apps already implement. I’m certain that if Grindr’s parent company doesn’t implement some sort of age verification, we will be seeing a huge lawsuit come from either a government or as a class action.",,Nobamallama,False,2022-10-22 01:27:08,2

11,4,Warning about Grindr,"What I want to say about this app that I really love Al lathe great people love have met and spoken to in it, the problem is that way too many people flake on the app or do not respond to you quickly so there’s a tendency to be somewhat upset and stressed out when you are on the app due to people playing games and making what you want to happen whether it’s a date, an interesting chat talk, hookup, and so on not happen and it leads to unhappiness and just stress. So if you download Grindr, know that you will have to have tough skin dealing with people like that cause it will have an effect on you 9 times out of 10. The stress and anxiety might come indirectly, but somehow, flakers have a way of affecting people by not meeting the need you are looking for on the app. Some people want to be in a relationship, want to hookup, go on a date.

(Yes developers, I’ve seen your responses to other reviews on this matter, but I know too many men in my own circles that are evidence to the contrary. Bottom line is your moderation system is terrible.) Speaking of my own circles, no one ever has anything good to say about this app. They just treat it like a necessary evil they have to put up with. I’m beginning to seek alternatives, and encourage others to do so as well. I would rather pay for a platform that provides me with some kind of benefit to do so, not because I feel like I’m being squeezed in a vice and have no other choice.

13,1,To be honest,App works well to network. Except glitches can really kill an opportunity. Lost messages sometimes make the other person believe you are not interested- and vice versa. When a regular text comes in on iPhone- the app gets weird. I decline the text- but the app goes offline- and photos and msgs I have sent prior to message notification are lost. Sometimes when I block soneone/ the app gets frozen- I have to turn iPhone off to restart after a long wait- usually 5 minutes. If guys are going to rely on this app- it needs to work correctly. Pics and messages need to be sent and received. Otherwise- someone may become offended that you have not responded to their message- and block you. When I send error reports- when I get a notification- what happens? Do you use this ? Or is it a waste of my time.? Until grinder gets kinks worked out- guys will use several apps at once- and not trust this app. Also- location goes haywire on occasion.

How many times do you see a white male in his underwear with the lining of his penis? (All the time) or any other “attractive” male. If any other race or person does that their picture is immediately removed. The culture that Grindr calls “inclusive” is the exact opposite. Grindr has been the worst experience when it comes to advertising of sexiness in races and culture. The LGBT community and the rest of the world as a whole is also to blame for this lack of consideration. Downloading this app was one of the worst decisions I have ever made in my life. Grindr and its developers are out to take our money and that’s it. The subscription prices are out of hand, and the amount of ads you see are insane. Scruff doesn’t force you to watch an ad to satisfy their ad experience. There are also more features and more people to see on Scruff.

Every time a Grindr server goes down, my app shows a “Cannot Refresh Page” error. Then, when the server is finally back up, my app becomes broken and crashes each time I attempt to open it. The only solution is to delete & redownload the app, which deletes all of my settings, blocked accounts, messages, and photos. This is an app I pay for — a pretty large sum of money too. Yet, I have had to delete all of my data three times these past several weeks. Backing up chats is cumbersome, as you’re rarely asked to back them up and it’s just weird to make users manually do it when it’s a task that should’ve been automated.

Additionally, they actually offer zero support in terms of preventing this type of behavior. I ended up hopping off the app hoping they’d get bored but they persisted. 

There is no verified status (tinder has), and no internal system that tracks similar photos being uploaded by other users. It’s actually quite funny that when you post a photo you have a period of waiting where it needs to be approved. Why aren’t people caught at this stage for using someone else’s photos? At a bare minimum if you’re charging that much for ultimate - you need to include some safety features. Ideally, incorporate safety for all users.

When I check my app history it does indeed show I have downloaded 2 different apps from the app store.

But then Apple issued it a different ID that doesn’t match the previous one. Fix it!! I got hundreds of chats and photos in that backup that I want back!

While most of them have been great, paid grindr is actually worse than the free version. You consistently have to force close the app for some of the extra features to work (the recently viewed tab for instance). The paid version has a message search feature. This has never, ever worked. In fact, it's crashed the app every time I've ever tried to use it. I don't bother anymore. I recently opened the app and found that the interface had reverted to the free version, as if I had cancelled my subscription (I hadn't). This is the second time this has happened. 

The worst part? I've opened tickets about most of these issues. They've never fixed any of them after multiple app updates. They just tell you to force close the app, or delete and re-download it. Anyway, I'll be cancelling my subscription soon, and I wouldn't recommend the paid version to others. You're just paying for a buggy app where the free version is much more stable.",,Lazarus Riley,False,2021-02-10 01:11:08,1
20,5,GOOD JOB FOR WHAT?!,"Grindr and Jack’d are ANALOGOUS for what?Might as well be one app.
Only thing different is the target audience (Grindr: privilege/ Jack’d: Minority), 
allowing screenshots within chat (Grindr: Yes/ Jack’d: No) 
though in my opinion i think screenshots should be disabled within the whole app itself, but if not at least the profile search page to see who’s nearby out of respect of others’ privacy that they claim they want,
sending pics and videos (Jack’d: yes/ Grindr: only pics but videos gotta be sent live) 
and i get the live video from Grindr but wen i wanna feel lazy i just wanna send the video i already got that’s been working just fine to confirm that I’m legit because this black don’t crack,
navigational location dropping (Jack’d: yes/ Grindr: No) 
and Grindr drops the location but you would have to type it out unless you have the world map memorized,
and maybe the subscription but that’s sad in itself should jus be one price in my opinion, but we got profit feens.
Other than that everything is cool i mean there’s probably other things i haven’t covered but there are other issues not pertaining to the apps but individuals themselves that may need time to look at a reflection of themselves to reevaluate and I'm still learning this myself. Just gotta take it a day at a time and use your time wisely.",,La Flo Real,False,2021-08-22 17:23:21,3

Customer service reported and they are now not even responding. I cannot enter email address for account it’s the same window when reinstall it every time.  I don’t have another number to enter.

22,1,FORCED UPDATES,"They are FORCING you to update. With every update there are less and less guys on your feed and access to les and less features. They constantly limit your feed and create blocks with the explore feature. Its bad enough you have to watch the ADS after every message, they do everything to inconvenience you, waste your TIME, just to corral you into buying premium when you are simply trying to connect with a few people on the grid. If I cant see all the guys in my small town within a 5 mile radius, theres something WRONG with that! Its ALSO discrimination against low income individuals, people of color, and minority communities. especially when they REMOVED the feature that let me find my own people, you cant search by “race” anymore, so if you want to connect with your own people, GOOD LUCK! I shouldn't have to use the EXPLORE feature just to find my own people, and even with that they limit you to 3 “free” searches per day.

23,1,ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY,"Grindr does not protect its community. They DO NOT uphold their own community guidelines and the photo moderators are a joke. A profile has been reported over ten times for a prominently displayed unobstructed view of an erect penis as its public profile photo. It is clearly pornographic in nature and explicitly banned in the community guidelines. And yet the photo moderators keep letting the user post it. In app reports result in zero action. Emails to the grindr help desk get stock responses claiming the issue has been rectified without addressing the fact they keep letting this happen. They take the photo down then let the user post it up right away. Complaints to grindr go unanswered. What is the point in allowing users to indicate they do not want to receive unsolicited nude photos while simultaneously subjecting them to the same images?!? DO YOUR JOB AND PROTECT THE COMMUNITY. Now cue a stock response from the app developers not actually addressing the complaint….

25,1,People using my photos AGAIN,"It’s happened a few time on this site to where it was brought to my attention that a user was using my photos. Im not even on this site and I haven’t been for years. They do nothing for verification and those using my photos were harassing other users. This is troubling especially in contrast to the work that I do. In the past I have come to realize that, If you use this app, expect to meet those with fake profiles and those that solicit money for sex. Next time I will have to take legal action against the app for defamation if they continue to allow the use of my copyrighted photos. Such apps should not be allowed on the App Store. On all personal sites, no one should be allowed to troll with no photo, no info, or at least with out verification. If these sites used verification, it will end fake users and identity theft. Discretion defeats the purpose on this site and catering to those of discretion causes way more problems then the disallowing of it. It’s a personals site, stop allowing those that hide and watch the app soar.","{'id': 8227213, 'body': 'Rest assured that Grindr does not condone or allow impersonation in the community, 🚫 we strive to create a safe and comfortable place for everyone in our App. Please contact us at help-ios@grindr.com so we can remove these profiles.', 'modified': '2021-11-10T19:39:34Z'}",WhoIAm2U,True,2021-11-10 19:39:34,1

27,4,Suggested app improvements,"Some feedback for the design and product teams: 

There are some back to basics improvements to the app UX which would make a big difference to how easy it is to use Grindr. Especially around navigation actions that people do constantly.

Can you please (re) introduce edge swipe to exit-back-to-grid from the profile page? It’s such an important navigation gesture, and having to always tap the “<“ icon in the top left is super cumbersome.

Also… it would be great if you could have swipe left and right to navigate through photos in an album. Trying to force the Instagram stories tap-to-next image affordance just doesn’t really work in this context. Even better would be to allow zooming in and out of photos without having to tap and wait (that’s something you can do from anywhere in IG which is an excellent capability).

Lastly, performance: the whole app is going slowly, but there are 2 key areas that drive me crazy: tapping into a profile, tapping to exit a profile, and tapping the little flame “tap” feature. Everything has slowed to a crawl. Pause work on new features, and devote a sprint or two to improving app performance.

As the saying goes: performance is a feature. 

Thanks so much!",,apple napple,False,2022-08-11 09:45:18,3
28,1,Bad verification cannot get account back,"I signed up for Grindr under the unlimited membership and mistyped my email address. Since Grindr does phone verification and also does not send a welcome email,  instead of verifying email address and then phone, I was never aware of my mistake. Now I am locked out of my account and I have sent them my photo I’d and my profile pictures and they are not able to restore my account to me after 3 support tickets. I will be talking to the attorney general. I sent in my pictures and my drivers license and they say I can’t have my account unless I know the email address. Why can’t you use the phone that I verified it with. If you can’t give me my account with my own pictures then what hope is there. I called the company and left a detailed message. The system is flawed for sure. It needs to verify your email and your phone instead of just phone. If you sign up make sure you type in and screenshot it what email address you used otherwise if you lose it you are likely screwed.",,MattyHart,False,2021-01-16 15:25:34,1
29,2,Really going downhill since I was last using it.,"Honestly this app used to be really good at one time. But honestly it’s on a decline for me. Between the spam accounts, nothing being done about reporting abusive accounts, and the biggest is everything is becoming xtra on the app. 

I can understand needing to make money from an app and rightfully so but honestly with the newest update and now the fresh section only lets you view 6 people and anymore is now xtra when before you could view 20 people. And before that it was 5$ to use xtra for 24 hrs now it’s 10$. Everything in the app is pretty much going xtra now. 

I laugh thinking one day I’m going to open the app and it’s gonna say “xtra to open the app”. Like I said I can understand making money off the app but there’s a limit between making money and annoying consumers who use it by starting to limit it especially when there’s ads running almost every time you click on something in the app.",,Zoldmugi,False,2022-08-03 18:50:41,2
30,1,Crashing issues,"In the last week, my Grindr app has started crashing every time I’ve tried opening it, sending me right back to my home screen. I was a couple versions behind, so I thought upgrading it to the most recent version would fix it. It didn’t. I used a third party program to downgrade my app version even lower to see if maybe it was just a recent bug. Nope! Still crashing as low as 7.17.0. I believe this issue is server sided and nothing to do with the app version.

And despite having chats backed up, attempting to reinstall the app wiped my chat history AND my chat backup. I don’t really understand what the purpose is for cloud backups if reinstalling the app deletes them. Under what other circumstances would someone need chat backups other than having to reinstall the app?

I was in contact with the Grindr help email and they told me this was a bug they were aware was affecting multiple people. I hope they fix it soon, because these reviews are filled with people experiencing the same problem as I am.",,MyHatRules,False,2022-04-30 19:15:25,1
31,1,Grindr is grinding itself away,"Grindr go ahead and chew your own leg off. You are eating away at your product and customer base and goodwill. You should never have sold out, that’s when you went downhill. Foremost the price. Y’all lost your minds when you thought people would pay your original price for “unlimited”. You squandered those of us who had been paying for “Xtra” on that. I’d go with $99/year but even that is grossly pushing it and forget that $150+ mess you keep angling for.   Connection has been better lately but messages are still hit & miss coming through at times. Like how long now have we had instant messaging? Other apps seem to have conquered it a decade ago but you’re still working on it. Also the catfish and the bots on there are out of control but you won’t let people verify themselves and reflect that confirmation in their profiles. Identity and data theft is rampant.

32,1,I’ll never be back,"Not entirely by choice I’ll admit. But it’s time. I’ve hated Grindr and it’s toxic environment for long enough. After having my account banned countless times for no reason, no communication for explanation etc. I know there are others who have experience this. After just subscribing to extra 3 or 4 days ago then getting my account banned, because someone was rude to me, called me stupid in the app, and was upset when I then politely declined them. 
This sort of thing is all too common with this app. There is no other behavior or engagements I have prior to being banned each and every time this has happened. After paying money this time though for a more optimal experience, I am officially cutting my losses as I don’t expect trying for a refund is worth my time, imagining the lack of customer support.

I know the rules and I haven’t broken a single one, so I have no clue what this could possibly be about. The only thing I can think of for this random ban is that maybe a lot of people reported me because they are upset that I did not text back??? I have no clue, I did get quite a bit of messages and maybe people got mad that I wasn’t responding to most of their unsolicited d pics and “hey” messages. But, even if I did do something wrong, why would grindr not tell you? Or give you a warning?  You are only left with the knowledge that you broke their rules but they do not specify which ones. I tried to appeal but they purposefully made that process complicated and they have not yet got back to me after making that appeal.
They will ban you out of nowhere and  never tell you what you did wrong, it’s just a matter of when tbh.","{'id': 32960768, 'body': ""We at Grindr assure you that we don't ban for no reason.

34,2,A basic review.,"As an 18 year old, this app can be filtered by age, body type, and much more. Throughout my experience, this is not a dating app. I’ve had numerous accounts say they’d love to 🔩 me in my house, car, etc. I’ve had to delete my profile lots of times because of these issues. I’ve also had to move to Tinder because other guys are horny for younger guys. In extreme measures, I have had to involve the police due to a person that stalked me, threatened me and would do bodily harm towards me. I always feel like an object when I use the app. Just because of my body, face, and the clothing I wear. If the app had a verified badge by the name (like Tinder does), the app would be safer to know who you are meeting with. I also fear for my safety as the men on this app are really disgusting. As a person still trying to find my sexuality, this is not an app to download if you want to date. I’d highly recommend Tinder. Overall, not a dating app. It is unsafe.

Grindr harasses its free members to get a paid subscription by bombarding them with ads in the midst of replying or viewing a message. I’m convinced that the ads are not meant to be relevant to most end users, but rather to annoy them into a paid subscription. 

The other thing that Grindr does to its unpaid members that it does not do to its paid members, is that it purposely limits the amount of people you can view who are online and in your proximity and rather shows you people who are offline and further away. The latest app update also brought with it a glitch that shows users to be within a few thousand feet from you when in reality they are a few miles away.

36,1,Security risk caused ban,This apps support and security are abysmal. My profile was hacked by their lack of security allowing someone to reset my password. Support simply banned me after I was hacked and was no help in me recovering profile and they didn’t even believe that I was hacked until weeks of emails. They just said I know it was you. I lost that account snd had to make a new one but they did not delete the hacked profile. This app is full of scam artists snd drug dealers they do nothing about. The scams are run by the support staff themselves. That’s how they never get banned. My new account was banned for absolutely nothing. I’ve sent three emails which they’ve ignored and filled out the form in support to have ban lifted but all they did was resend a link for me to fill out the same form. So obviously support is just AI software and not a real human.

We never knew if the account got banned or terminated and I would love if they add a feature to where they update you about the situation. It would be super helpful.

It’s almost like the “X” at the top right corner or the close ad buttons are just there for show. You can’t close the ad at all most of the time. I usually have to force close the app to get the ad to go away. Just opening a message or checking who viewed me initiates this ad that literally will not go away unless I close the app! Is that good for you guys? Ads that literally force the consumer to close the app? It can’t be! A lot of times I’m so discouraged by all the ads I don’t even come back after force closing.

43,1,False ads,Grindr uses ads to keep the app free. But what nobody has brought up is that these ads make you click them and interact. With you clicking on that screen on those ads you are pressing a yes button to all sorts of other things behind the scenes. After doing so you’ll start to get texts from random numbers that are down right disgusting with links to pages that are just as bad. These ads need to be checked by Apple and I think with a full investigation. These links are to steal even more information and I know for a fact that Grindr is the ONLY way I’d be getting text and calls like these. Awful. Btw they don’t stop even if you block the numbers. Grindr is terrible at keeping up with bans and will also ban you permanently without any warnings or really looking into the problem with the users.

44,1,Poor App Function,"The one thing grindr has going for it is it’s ubiquity, it is the app with the largest user base and they know it. I can ignore the ads, overpriced subscription, and poor app management but the app has become largely unusable in the last few months. 

I have encountered a bug that crashes my phone and prevents the app from rebooting unless it is reinstalled from the App Store. This wouldn’t be a anything more than a hassle but every time it happens, I lose any chats I haven’t backed up to the iCloud. Entire conversations gone, embarrassing questions about who I’ve been chatting with, general frustration every time it happens. When I reached out to support they just said they are aware of the issue. This has been happening for several months now (at least since April for me) and there has been no attempts to remedy this bug.

45,3,Grindr is… well. Grindr.,"Grindr is a mess. Sure, it may make meeting other guys easily accessible. Although the pure fact that Grindr subliminally markets itself as way to get intimate with strangers while still claiming it’s for ‘gay dating’ is disappointing. What’s more sad is, most men let how they meet someone, and the platform they connected on, dictate that entire friendship/relationship moving forward. There’s so many double standards on the platform, which makes it harder to connect and create meaningful connections with people.

Also, it makes my iPhone 13 Pro Max feel like the surface of the sun, only with a few minutes of usage. Causes the display to Dim to a brightness I can barely even read. When you force reset your device as well, it causes the application to crash upon each attempt to launch the app. There’s still no fix for this.","{'id': 32892488, 'body': 'We’re sorry to hear you haven’t had a great experience on the app yet.

46,1,Grindr Gods continue to ruin app,"Instead of focusing on real improvements to the app like ridding spam bots once and for all, the Grindr gods continue to screw around with features like tags and age search functions. Instead of allowing their users choice in how they search for compatible matches the Grindr Gods continue to make things harder on their customers. 

Focusing solely on the issue of age searches, Grindr Gods have decided that no one will be permitted to search narrowly for users by age ranges any less than four years. The claim according to their customer service agents is that by setting it up that way it allows users to search more broadly for compatible matches. This of course is false because those who have free accounts (who are already limited to _ # of accounts that appear), are now further limited. 

If someone aged 19 wanted to find other 19 year olds in their area, they are now restricted from doing so and now can only search within a range up to 23. Likewise, a 35 year old seeking other 35 years olds must now default up to 39. Again, the Grindr Gods claim you get an expanded pool. Actually, the opposite is true because filtering by one year at a time could allow you to truly find more people, even if it at the cost of geographic proximity.  

Grindr needs to restore choice to its customers/users instead of telling us what they think is best for us.","{'id': 28525214, 'body': ""Hi there,\n\nWe really appreciate your feedback on the recent age filter changes that we've made.

Grindr will randomly cause my phone to restart, at first I thought it was related to how many preference filters I had at once, when I reduced them nothing changed. When I turned them all off nothing changed. Once my phone restarts I’ll try to open grindr and it will shut down before the app loads. I’ve tried restarting my phone rather than reinstalling, but that doesn’t work either. 

Once I reinstall I’ve lost all my messages, all my photos, everything except my profile pic and info is just gone. This can be upsetting for obvious reasons, but I think the worst is that I have previously paid for a 3 month subscription which was cancelled after 1 day because of this glitch. I have not received a refund nor have I received the service I paid for. So 3 months worth of money just down the drain? For a few hours of usage?

At this point I’ve given up. This app is useless, overall a terrible user experience, if you have the money to actually enjoy the apps features you’ll just lose it due to glitches and bugs. Highly recommend avoiding this app at all costs.","{'id': 30226701, 'body': ""Hi Noah,\n\nWe're sorry that you've had such a frustrating experience on our platform.

I’ll try to swipe to my home screen or swipe to close the app and even that gets very slow to the point where my phone will lock more than 5 seconds after I press the lock button.

Now it seems that I am unable to communicate with people of interests if they exceeds the radius I am searching for (either that or the number of profiles XTRA members can view and interact with). It seems silly that this feature was removed from a mid-tier subscription and bumped to a more expensive subscription. I was perfectly content with purchasing XTRA for the price point with that feature but now it seems that we are paying the same amount while losing features.

So you lose any connections, messages, everything. Yet the notifications keep coming even though I can’t launch the app at all anymore. Many of us pay a solid amount of money to this app over the years and its consistently unusable. Should get no stars as it won’t work reliably.

52,2,Get paid version or uninstall,"It’s just as useful as Grindr has always been, but now it’s just not worth how many ads one has to deal with to use the app. 

When I log in, I can look at one thing before I get an ad... NEWS FLASH: this app is meant to be used by checking in often. If I am just opening the app to check the area around me quickly, why would I be okay with having to watch a Candy Crush ad for any amount of time? 

Banner ads and these extremely numerous pop-ups are not the end of it. The user gets notification that someone sent you a message? No— there’s an ad in your inbox. Or two. Or three sometimes. Literally sometimes I have three unread messages in my inbox, I get so excited, and then I open the app and it’s three ads. PLUS if I want to delete any of those “messages” it might trigger a pop-up ad. 

Honestly the app just pisses me off when it forces me to watch an ad in the first five seconds of opening the app. Usually it puts me off to where I won’t open the app again for a while. Sometimes I have messages built up for days because the ads only let me read one message at a time.

Your “customer service” center replied saying they can’t tell me why I was banned, and the decision is final and will not be reviewed again. I’ve since tried and have gotten ZERO response. If you are going to ban someone, at LEAST tell them what rule or guideline they’ve broken, and give them a chance to redeem.

But the free version is pretty good. The only real issue I’ve had with the app is the constant ads. It’s hard to do anything because the majority of the time your screen is covered with an unskipable ad. Sometimes you can’t ever close them, and have to restart the app, only to be immediately greeted by… another ad!

However, this new update is something else. They changed the profile hud, and now it’s almost impossible to full screen a photo. And if you tap through their photos one too many times, it now will move you to the next profile. Very frustrating. 

But the real killer is whatever bitcoin mining crap or whatever it is they did behind the scenes. The app is now almost unfunctional. It will crash two or three times every time you use it, and might take 2 or 3 minutes just to load a new chat. It got so unbearable that I couldn’t even open the app, so I had to redownload it and lost all my recent chats with 20 unopened messages.

Server-side, the distance tracking doesn’t always update after pulling to refresh. Earlier last week it wasn’t even able to load Nearby.

One major red flag to start looking for scammers is whether they have their location hidden.  Some legitimate guys block it, but it’s a good reason to be on your guard.  Again, I get nearly ZERO scammers and bots on Scruff.

Finally, the subscription cost is MUCH more than it’s worth.  I understand they need to make money and it costs to maintain, etc.  But when they are putting ZERO effort to squelch scammers and bots.  I will be canceling my subscription when it renews.

Unfortunately they do everything else wrong. There is no actual customer service. Send them and email and weeks later you will get a canned response. The app is full of ads but worse are the bots! Grindr will randomly ban your account and your device with no reason given. So I assume your iPhone can never again be used to connect to the app (by you or someone who may buy your phone from you). Honestly, save yourself the time and frustration. Guys need to start using the many other apps out there that don’t give their users so many issues.

Also, removing the ability to choose to filter out certain races was not a smart idea.

93,1,Scammers and bots,For an app with so many users I’d expect their support and maintenance of fake accounts and scam accounts to be a lot better I can’t go one day without getting 4-5 messages from a scam account asking me to go to a certain website for sex or nudes or someone trying to get my bank information and they can’t say “we have no way mpf monitoring that” because clearly other apps do seeing as this is the only app I’ve ever had this problem with and the amount of adds are ridiculous if you’re going to try to charge so much for your app’s higher memberships at least make sure we are having a good experience with the free version or is the high price to get rid of the scam accounts if so that’s great marketing... your app is literal trash along with your developers and customer service.,,cmac_56,False,2020-12-27 21:45:28,1
94,1,Poor quality app,"Prior to today, Grindr would merely drain my phone battery faster than any other app, including competing apps like Scruff. It would also heat up my phone like no other app as though it is trying to process something in the background (very sus). Today, however, it crashes immediately when opening it. Doesn’t even give me a chance to drain my battery.

This combined with the ridiculous amounts of spam and fake accounts make Grindr just crap. I get a couple spam messages a day yet Grindr seemingly does nothing to stop the fake accounts. Meanwhile, Scruff rolled out verified profiles months ago and has never had the amount of spam I experience on Grindr.

Even with a subscription it’s crippled unless you go unlimited for an extra $40 per month. It crashes like ALOT. No kidding. The sad part is that it has always been buggy. I have gigabit service and it still can’t refresh and gets stuck. Lots of foreign actors spamming me. Anyone with location services turned off is a scammer. Just block them. Also they don’t understand SAE measurements so the height and weights don’t match the photo and it’s usually just one poor resolution screen capture pic so there’s a clue. Stay safe out there.

Further your app uses a ridiculous amount of analytics to take as much user data as possible to monetize for your intrusive and likely illegal ads. 

Your mobile ads, have a strategically placed icon over the option to dismiss the ad, or to click it’s privacy policy. 

Forcing the user to stay in the add the minimum time allowed, just long enough to generate your ad revenue. 

That’s disgusting, disrespectful to your users since 2009, and an insult to those who follow your platforms rules.

Servers constantly crashing, saying unable to refresh, “connecting” that’s all technical and is related to the poor upkeep of your servers.

Apparently I was reporting too many profiles and this was distracting to the techs pulling them away from their duties.  Huh??? Each profile reported violated Grindr’s policy and each profile reported I can prove violated policy.  As a full paid client, I did not expect this poor reason.

Customer service that is corresponding via e-mail are the most unprofessional individuals. The LGBTQ Community should start developing an alternative app and people should move away from Grindr.

Update after Developer’s response:

I’d never again, even if they pay me, use Grindr application.

101,3,"Slow, sluggish and often freezes and renders the entire phone useless","Thank you for making this app, I’m sure it’s not easy to maintain. I like the app but find myself using it less and less because it seems to take over my entire system. 

It will usually work for maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute and then it immediately drags, loads so slow that I have to simply put down the phone, walk away and hope I can do something else. In an environment of communication or chat it is horrible. To type hello has taken anywhere from 15-30 seconds. 

The phone gets very hot, it impacts my ability to use the phone at all and sometimes freezes and I have to leave the phone for minutes until it comes back to use. 

The Grindr app is the only one that does this on my phone; I deleted the app for 6 months and contemplating again as I can’t afford the time kill. 

I have iPhone 12, IOS 15.3 up-to-date, I have stopped the device, restarted the phone and reinstalled several times.

102,4,After six weeks...,"...it turns out I like Grinder a lot. I like the directness of it, I like the ethnic and age diversity. and even tho I am older than the general  demographic I am delighted that I am still attractive to men!

Of course, the 'once and done' part is frustrating, but that's hook-up culture in general, not Grinder. And I've had some great conversations and met some very sweet guys.  

One grumble are some of the ads. I understand that they are necessary, but some of the ones that pop up are really obnoxious (like the PayPal/Solitaire add that will sometimes literally not go away unless I log out) or the one game ad that features someone with a sub-machine gun mowing down hundreds of people--which given our out-of-control gun culture is both distressing and tone deaf. (And I know game culture is violent, but does Grinder really have to support it?)

Also, it would be nice to be able to delete one's trace (like one can on Adam4dam) but that's a minor complaint.

People can find where one is based on other user’s locations whether they like it or not. The opt out of location sharing still does not opt a person out of the grid. So much stalking occurs due to this. On top of this the company has been selling identifiable user data to data brokers (your exact location, email address, phone number etc.. This company should not still exist for having done this. There are still data “leaks” as well. The company has no concern for user privacy and misleads its users.

These apps are a great tool in meeting for some, but it can also be a sketchy place. Catfish will use other users photos, or just take someone’s photo from Instagram or Facebook, claiming to be them.

It would be very helpful if there was an option to opt out of advertisements (for a 1 time payment). Because, if you use the free version of the app (like me), every time you message someone or block someone, an add pops up. It is very frustrating!

I personally had a horrible experience with a stalker who made multiple profiles of me on Grindr in different countries and linked my Instagram to every one. He contacted several friends and family members, saying lies to hurt my reputation. This lasted about two years and I never found out who they are. I filed multiple reports and Grindr didn’t do anything about it; I even went to the police several times and the digital crimes unit of my local police station tried contacting Grindr to no avail.

120,5,underage problem,there is a huge flaw with this app. you can be 17 and download it which is already a red flag. then they don’t have any systems of checks or balances to assure if someone is 18 or not. just per reports and speculations. an ID check would definitely help this app improve. right now there’s plenty of minors on the app if you’re a predator please do not take advantage of that situation! grindr do better and prevent kids from accessing your site. no simple ‘are you 18’ question is working you guys are ignorant if you think that works.

121,3,Spammers allowed to use Grindr’s bad algorithms to ban those who report them,"I was repeatedly targeted by mostly Ghanaian trolls claiming to be US military men looking for love so they could collect and sell my information. When they realized I wasn’t falling for it, they reported me to Grindr and Grindr banned me. Permanently. 

The reason this happened, and can easily happen to you, is that Grindr is built on a system that makes it nearly impossible to restore an account, have a fair hearing with human interaction, or even receive human email communications to dispute the company’s seemingly arbitrary decisions to disable or ban an account. 

I was told they had the right to ban an account for any - or no - reason at all. That was the most specific explanation I was given after many attempts to understand my banishment. 

This system allows the anti-LGBTQ+ trolls who target Grindr’s members nearly free reign. And Grindr allows it.

And now a computer generated Grindr response saying they take these comments seriously in............

122,1,Tragic,"Tragic is the only word to describe this app. It’s really sad how greedy the developers got before they sold out. It’s all about selling your personal data including your searches and health history. There’s not even the pretense of being interested in operating a “dating” or hookup app. You’re just another income stream and all the data on your phone is for sale.  
Every even slightly worthwhile feature is hidden behind an overpriced subscription. Seriously, read the fine print of the user agreement. It’s truly frightening. 
Most of the profiles are fakes or “anonymous” with no photos or any profile information. And the ads are not only non-stop, but they’re for kiddie games, which makes one wonder if the developers are marketing this to 8-year-olds. 
 Geolocation is a joke! 
The “acceptable” photo policy is draconian and probably censored by Chinese party officials. It’s probably why most profiles are blanks. 
There are plenty of better gay hookup apps. Pass this one by. They’ve built in plenty of fake profiles and bots to make it appear that you’re being cruised, but any idiot can tell that it’s all a fraud.

This shouldn’t happen unless you do inadequate regression testing, you don’t care about your existing customers’ experience or you care more about making money from new feature changes.

Furthermore, if the app is trying to create a better online environment, the least they could do is list the reasons why you are getting banned and educate their users so they not what not to do. Having an array of reasons why you’d get banned that don’t pertain to you seems ludacris. 

Some people are banned because other users can’t handle rejection and report them for whatever reason. Grindr should have an automated verification process. Also, if you bought a year subscription and they ban you in the first month, you won’t get your money back, you will just be prompted to cancel your renewal, which seems like a cash grab.

Now, that isn’t necessarily Grindr’s fault, but they don’t do much to curb it. For such exclusion, they are grossly overpriced Xtra features. It’s literally priced similar to a home utility service.

The tons and tons of spam and bot accounts are ridiculous. Their inability to control that issue is perplexing; considering their cost for paid services, as well as the ad revenue.

Grindr is a great place to meet guys, depending where you’re located. However, it could stand to use some useful features. The “tap” feature is not one of them.
