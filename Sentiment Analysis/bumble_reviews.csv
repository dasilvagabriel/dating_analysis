I did some research and decided to try Bumble first as I was looking for something serious. The app is really easy to use, I just wished the chat window was a bit more interactive and allowed to delete messages (lol), but again the purpose of this app is just to use it as a first step and continue chatting/texting out of it once you think you have a match. As a woman, is nice to be able to take the first step to initiate the conversation. I had 3 dates with really nice guys before finding my current boyfriend (we‚Äôll soon be celebrating our first anniversary!), so we are both very happy we found each other with this app. The only thing I would recommend them to change is to allow choosing pictures from your phone instead of Facebook. I met one guy who had old photos on Facebook because he just didn‚Äôt interact with it a lot, so when we met in person he looked a bit different. Overall it was a good app, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something serious, guys here were really nice, some really well educated, and a couple were absolute gentleman.",5,False,Ger R.,Great app for those looking for something serious

The developer left a response where they reminded me that I get new swipes every 24 hours, encouraging me to reach out to support if my swipes are not resetting and I appreciate the response.

As a girl, this does make things a little awkward, but it helps to be the one making the first move. As in other dating apps, guys typically hit girls with pickup lines or flat out ask if they want to hook up. I felt like I could explain what I was looking for so much easier with bumble.

I recently decided to give it another go, but in order to actually see any of the people who like you you have to pay a $21 subscription fee. What‚Äôs the point? Look, I‚Äôm completely understanding that companies are looking to make money off of apps, but most of them allow you to use basic features for free, or at the very last show ads. That‚Äôs not even the case at all here. They let you waste time building a profile, adding pictures, seeing if there‚Äôs anyone you want to match with, then God forbid anyone likes you back and you want to see them, you have to subscribe. Also $21 is steep. Most streaming services don‚Äôt cost half of that price and it just seems insane to me. I will uninstall and never use again when there‚Äôs plenty of other working options for this type of thing out there that let you use their service without requiring paying monthly. Also, it‚Äôs $21 a WEEK, $45 a month.

Also can you cut the crap with the adding pronouns section? If somebody cares so much about letting you know, they can easily put it in their bio. Thanks for the heads up.

Happened to get off all dating app platforms shortly afterwards until just recently, and trying to get my purchase restored to my new account has been a nightmare.

First off, I‚Äôm fairly certain Bumble is the sole app that lacks an in-app purchase restoration option, which feels pretty shady.  As far as I can tell, they also lack a customer service chat AND phone number, leaving e-mail as the only available method.  Initially, I was told they couldn‚Äôt find my purchase receipt.  Then, after explaining that I was not the primary account holder in my Family Plan and perhaps it was tied to that email ‚Äî though it shouldn‚Äôt be, as it was made my from previous Bumble account tied to my Apple ID ‚Äî they stated they had in fact already found it, but they would instead need the payment confirmation from my email.  Ended up providing it in a response, then tried following up and even sent a whole new inquiry, and still have yet to hear anything from them after several hours.

I have to ask, is this an intentional run-around to withhold services despite payment?  Perhaps even aiming at further purchases made out of exasperation?",2,False,ComfyCostes,Pretty Horrendous Customer Service

Liberal means favoring freedom and liberty (also having respect for and being open to others‚Äô opinions, whether political or not), while conservative means liking the laws and government to be conserved, or stay the same.

So after much self-reflection and being a pretty self-aware human I can honestly say I was a gentleman and did nothing out of context. Which brings me to the conclusion that this app is filled with insecure, scammy, and users. I would personally recommend Hinge or even Tinder is better then the experience I had on this one.",1,False,thispartylookswack,"BEWARE OF FLAKES, INSECURITIES , & USERS!!!"

I strongly believe it is a feminist based concept to empower women in the wrong way. It‚Äôs a cool concept at first but if you step back and look at is in reverse it would be hell to pay if women where not allowed to speak first. People are creepy not just men. I came across several women that where psychotic and severely delusional about reality of relationships. It‚Äôs not very diverse it‚Äôs for white men whom are 28-40 making 6 figures a year. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs seems to be the status quo ‚Äústatus‚Äù. If you do match with a female to beat the 24 hr timer they say ‚Äúhello‚Äù and nothing else. So then you stay in que indefinitely. You never here back from them. My account was moderated for no reason. I don‚Äôt use bad language I‚Äôm respectful. They could not tell me what I said to violate policy.

It‚Äôs not complicated to understand and set up your preferences. My main issue is that there is barely ANY interaction. Paying for the premium version doesn‚Äôt increase your chances of meeting someone or interacting. Not unless you pay for more views? It‚Äôs odd to think that setting up your profile, verifying it, and paying for premium, results in no return. The likes I did happen to have were only though the unverified profile option. So how do I know these profiles are legitimate? Are these people even on this app anymore? Most of the people I really was hoping to interact with don‚Äôt interact back - even with a match. Extending the time limit for a match hoping to contact you is pointless - they do not respond 99% of the time.

Also, the notification system on the app is poor. If I didn‚Äôt check it more often I could easily miss some connections and I know some people have missed the match with me because they never got a notification about it. In addition there are too many flaky people on the app which makes it almost worthless. There should be some kind of algorithm on the app that punishes those who are here just to collect matches and who don‚Äôt communicate once matched.

The next two months there was maybe one new user every two weeks, but the app still kept sending me random push notifications. I thought, ‚Äúwhatever, I will just let the subscription run out. It was only $67. Low and behold, I have been trying to cancel my subscription so I wouldn‚Äôt renew but there is no way to do it. I was just charged ANOTHER $67. I have gone through the process on the bumble website, tried all of the online walkthroughs both in-app and in Apple settings, none of the walkthroughs work. I do not have an option to cancel my subscription. I can only change my subscription to a different dollar amount after this new pay period ends, a minimum of $8 a month.

2021-08-18 22:54:47,,"The dating platform itself is fairly well designed and effective, so no complaints there. My complaints are with the business practices Bumble, and unfortunately most dating apps, use. The one that caused me to write this review is this: SuperSwipes and Spotlights expire one week after a membership ends. This is extremely scummy. I got a one week membership and started talking with someone, so I did not use them. After that did not work out, I went to try and use my Spotlight and it was gone. No notification telling me to use it before it expired, nothing. This is beyond unfair as I paid for the week membership, SuperSwipes, and Spotlight, and I had 2/3 of that taken away from me without notice. I tried contacting support, where I found out about this expiration. I got a robotic apology for any ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact Bumble took away things I paid for because of an arbitrary and unethical expiration date.

I want to thank you for creating this amazing platform! This has been a life changing experience for me. Personally, Bumble hasn‚Äôt only served a dating app, but it was a huge support in my liberation process. 
I have grown up in a extremely misogynistic community where I inherited most of the behaviors, self-concept, and everything about ‚Äúlove‚Äù and ‚Äúpartnership.‚Äù Unsurprisingly, this was a miserable time of my life, and after I reflected, it was all connected to my lack self awareness, self love, and boundaries. Getting bumble has shown a whole world of opportunities. It taught me the magic of moving on, accepting rejection, setting boundaries and never negotiating with less than I deserve, and most importantly that there‚Äôs always someone else, always. 
This process has freed me from my fears, anxieties, and the misogyny that had controlled me for 3 decades. Thank you for being with me on this journey and helping me love life ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,False,ahmadsharif,Life Changing

That only works for heterosexual people, and there is no way to change that setting. Cis-identifying queer people have no way of seeking platonic friendships safe from the risk of harassment or sexual pressure. And the utilization of the binary completely removes choice and sense of belonging for trans and non-binary folx for whom harassment and sexual pressure are never off the table anyways.

In short, why is the platonic side of this app geared first and foremost with cis-hets in mind, with virtually no liberty for queer people? Do we not deserve friends of our own choosing?

The women choose format is kind of refreshing but it seems like a lot of women either don‚Äôt know how the app works, are too timid to actually ‚Äúmake the first move‚Äù (a.k.a. literally type/send one letter or more to enable a conversation) or just swiped for kicks thinking it wouldn‚Äôt actually match.

There a decent amount of active users in most areas, which is essential. Unfortunately, you have to pay to see if anyone is interested. That might not be so bad if it was a reasonable price but $30/mo  to find out a bunch of people you weren‚Äôt interested in liked you is a total ripoff.

Overall, I‚Äôd recommend Hinge over Bumble or Tinder. Other services claim to care about your experience but monetize the crap out of critical features. Hinge, on the other hand, gives you all of that stuff for free. Yes, you read that correctly; they don‚Äôt make you pay to see who ‚Äúlikes you‚Äù.

It‚Äôs very annoying though. I don‚Äôt want to have to check the app every day and I didn‚Äôt, so I always was losing matches. Big reason I stopped using this 

Women are required to message first when matching with men in the dating mode. Yeah I get it, guys usually message first, but, they‚Äôve never been required to. It seems they think it‚Äôs some sort of activism breaking gender norms, but all that does is reverse it. Not getting the goal there. This feature is similar to the being forced to only make friends with the same-sex feature. This along with my next critique ruined the dating mode for me

Firstly, I‚Äôm bi. Bumble is surprisingly not queer friendly. It seems like it would be, since it gives you 1 million gender options, but if you‚Äôre searching for same-gender matches in the dating section, it shows you people from the friends section also, who are evidently looking for friends, not dates.

However, I still believe, like most dating apps, they have no incentive to show you only active members I‚Äôve seem friend profiles and I know they not been on Bumble for over a year, they forgot their logon.  But with no way of knowing if they are active human users, and gobs and gobs of people to swipe on, I doubt more than 10% are actually active daily users. 

This fake building of your hopes is important because you can purchase a boost for your visibility, to hopefully get more matches, but without knowing when may be a peak time for active human viewers, it is just a random guess and generally is a waste of money without any other metrics to know if it is a valuable use of time and money.

For improvements I‚Äôd like to see consumer friendly changes...I‚Äôd like to know when the best time to buy promotions to get the best value for my money.

This may be exclusive to iPhone users but I cannot count how many times i have tried to use the iPhone‚Äôs ‚Äúback‚Äù feature of swiping left to right like on every single other app to go to the previous page but I and prompted with the reply where I must cancel then hit the back arrow. Plus if you press and hold a message you already have reply amongst other things as and option.

2. Allow us to control when the 24hr countdown until unmatch begins. Alot of people do not have access to their phones every single day and or are able to check the app to see if you have matched. It would be great if the 24hr timer starts after you view the matched person‚Äôs profile. Because who knows you could match with youre true soulmate but didnt know it because your phone was broke or you were out camping or on a business trip without access to your phone ect.",4,False,hellsxfist,Almost a great dating app

1) the use of meaningless hieroglyphic icons that seem to randomly switch around on every page makes navigation very tedious and difficult; WHEN will developers learn to use text menus that we can just look at to see what they‚Äôre for, instead of having to experiment by clicking on every one to see if they do something useful or are what we‚Äôre looking for?  A single drop down text menu in the upper left corner where menus belong would be a massive improvement in usability, instead of scattering meaningless hieroglyphs randomly around the screen. 

2) poor contrast of light yellow-orangey text on white backgrounds in Setup areas makes certain operations slow and difficult. Not as bad as the use of meaningless icons, but still unnecessary. Suspect the developer isn‚Äôt using naive testers on a variety of devices like he should, but instead is probably developing on a Mac with a high contrast screen where his light-on-light text is discernible and where the use of meaningless hieroglyphics for navigation has long been standard practice‚Äîand the reason that I and many others loathe Apple products.",1,False,Simanonok,Improved from before

I realIze that the level of detail and customization in other dating apps sometimes causes issues, but the profiles here are so bare that it is, in most cases, impossible to get more than vague, rudimentary hints about a person even if they fully fill out their profile 

This means you basically just have to swipe right on people you find attractive, which is a crappy, unhelpful, and honestly fairly objectifying thing for a supposedly progressive dating app. 

Profiles simply aren‚Äôt detailed enough, and I do not like having to base all my decisions on physical attractiveness or what job someone has. Give us space to write!

Update: others have mentioned this too, so I will chime in. The way this app handles locations is really terrible. I live in a city five miles east of Seattle. If I am at home, 100% of this app‚Äôs matches are in Seattle, most of them between 10 and 15 miles away, despite the fact that there are almost 6 highly populated cities closer than this.

For starters, give people more than 24 hours. People work, and don‚Äôt get on the app every day or multiple times a day. This is a missed opportunity for meeting someone.

Also, if you travel, (because the app tracks your location), you‚Äôll get people within that mile range no matter where you go, instead of keeping it around where you actually live/will want to have a relationship.
Because of these reasons, this app isn‚Äôt worth using, in my opinion. It‚Äôs a good initial idea, but the people I matched with, I may have missed an opportunity because they weren‚Äôt on every day. Again, people work, have kids to take care of, etc.

You could always have an option to let users choose who they can match with. If men and women want to match they should be able to. And nonbinary folks should not have to choose a gender they will exclusively match with. If anything they should have control over who theyre seen by.

 Tinders premium gave me 100‚Äôs of likes a day, yet I was only receiving 3 guys who ‚Äòliked‚Äô my profile in a day on bumble.

Even on premium, the algorithm doesn‚Äôt work in your favor.
 
Good thing I had put my snap hashtag in my bio when I made the profile. I kinda figured that if a guy REALLY wanted to talk to me, he would contact me in any way he could. 

Honestly, Ladies, you can really benefit from just throwing your snap/insta out there, it could save you money. I paid for the premium, and still didn‚Äôt meet anyone that way.

The profile is laid out in an itemized fashion like an o-miai, but without the convenient arranged meeting after a match. The questions they give you to express yourself are geared towards individuals who want to say something without saying anything.

 Example: Beaches or mountains? 

At first blush one might think these profile-filler things would do a lot of work for you, but for anybody looking for a casual interaction it‚Äôs too pedantic and for those looking for something serious it‚Äôs pure frippery.

You should not try this app unless you want to meet people trying to come out of their shell through it. All but the very young has been either up their own [business] or loaded down with stuff a habitual tech user wouldn‚Äôt be capable of handling.

I‚Äôm back on bumble and since returning I‚Äôve noticed something. The pool of people for me has changed. I used to find pretty attractive guy on here and now I‚Äôm lucky to find ok looking guys, but most are not attractive. Maybe the algorithm was messed up when my first profile vanished.
